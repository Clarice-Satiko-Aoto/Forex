Kidnapped By A Narcissist: The GOP's Stockholm Syndrome,"It is two months since Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, promising us a ""Trump"" who would now be ""presidential."" So let's take inventory of the improvements.",Politics,HuffPost,"It is two months since Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, promising us a ""Trump"" who would now be ""presidential."" So let's take inventory of the improvements. He used his new platform to spew personal grievances at the ""Mexican"" judge -- a native of Indiana -- presiding over a lawsuit against the patently fraudulent Trump University. He accused American soldiers in Iraq of massive stealing. He revived the absurd claim that Vince Foster was murdered; suggested that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination; and expressed doubt as to whether Mitt Romney was a ""real"" Mormon. In the wake of the Orlando massacre, he insinuated that American Muslims knew about prospective acts of terrorism; renewed his call for the surveillance of Muslim communities; and intimated that President Obama sympathized with ISIS. He appeared as the guest of a lunatic talk show host who claims that 9/11, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, and the Boston Marathon bombing were either fabricated or perpetrated by the federal government -- assuring this madman that ""your reputation is amazing."" Confronted with a tape from the 1990s which he pretended to be a PR guy in order to brag about his own wealth and romantic conquests, Trump simply lied. Indeed his litany of lies accumulated daily and, it sometimes seemed, hourly. All the while he neglected the real work required of a general election candidate -- organization and fundraising -- preferring the roar of the crowd to the responsibilities of a leader. Among GOP professionals, the light slowly dawned. The man who thrived in the hothouse of disinformation and resentment peculiar to Republican primaries was, ineluctably, a one -- trick narcissist who has no second act. Faced with their concerns, Trump told them to get over it. ""Don't talk,"" he said of party leaders. ""Please be quiet. [B]ecause they have to get tougher... they have to get smarter, and we have to have Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself."" But left to his own devices, Trump has the self - destructive self - involvement common to malignant narcissists. He refuses to learn; or to bone up on policy; or to listen to advice; or, in general, to do anything which suggests a sense of obligation to his party -- let alone the country. Trump is his own campaign and his only cause, obsessed with feeding the boundless need for admiration fueled by his psychic emptiness. He is not ""off -- message"" -- in his own mind, he is the message. Thus his disastrous trip to Scotland was vintage Trump, rich, as ever, in the self- infatuation which renders him oblivious to everything and everyone but the wonder who is ""Trump."" He graced Scotland to, of all things, hype his renovation of the golfing resort at Turnberry -- blithely ignoring the misgivings of party professionals racked with worry about the chaos of Trump's campaign. Despite arriving mere hours after the Brexit vote, he devoted his press conference to, no kidding, a long account of how he had ""made Turnberry great again"" -- ""built to the highest standards of luxury"" -- capping this with a loving description of two hotel suites in a lighthouse. His numerous broken promises to the local community went conveniently unmentioned. Pressed to address the small matter of Brexit on a day when markets were crashing worldwide, Trump cheerfully opined that a decline in the value of the pound would be terrific for his business interests. After a few gratuitous shots at David Cameron and some kind words for Vladimir Putin, he proffered the remarkable suggestion that the prospective breakup of the European Union was a good thing, intimating that -- as, no doubt, everything does -- it reflected the influence of his own campaign. With his usual inattention to matters occurring outside his own head, he commended the Scottish people for ""taking their country back"" -- ignoring that over 60% of Scots had just voted to remain in the European Union. Asked if he had consulted about these matters with his foreign policy advisers, he answered, ""I've been in touch with them but there's really nothing to talk about."" Including, it seems, the prospects of a global economic calamity. As ever, oblivious. But no longer impervious. For the media worm has very much turned. For weeks now, various media apologists have denied any responsibility for Trump's rise -- even though the $3 billion in free media he received had, in large measure, the journalistic rigor of an infomercial. Now a study from the Shorenstein Center at Harvard confirms that, during the primary season, the media gave Trump a boost unprecedented in modern political reportage. Well before his poll numbers soared, the study shows, a wave of favorable coverage propelled Trump ever upward. This was essential to his success. He started with no constituency, credentials or organization worth the name - nothing but celebrity, a message of primitive outrage, and a media megaphone to spread it. No media, no Trump. But no more. Whether from professionalism, shame or both, the media has started covering him in depth. For a mendacious ignoramus who has no depth, this is deadly. No longer can Trump lie or change positions with impunity -- reporters are checking facts and asking follow-up questions, the building blocks of decent journalism. And a few commentators dared to state what has always been true: that the only explanation for Trump's behavior was a disqualifying psychological condition -- narcissistic personality disorder. This analysis allowed reporters -- and Hillary Clinton -- to assess Trump in terms of ""character,"" ""judgment,"" and ""fitness."" And so, at last, the central question surfaced: ""Who is this man?"" Trump's answer was a blacklist of media banned from covering him, tended by the man himself, supplemented by verbally incontinent twitter attacks. His spleen knows no constitutional bounds -- he has spoken of changing libel laws so that he could more easily sue the media, and using his power as president to target those which displeased him. All this was duly noted. So, too, was Trump's contempt for the rule of law in general. His assertion that judges could be disqualified based on their ethnicity. His prior attempts to disqualify judges who displeased him. His unconstitutional proposals to ban all Muslims from abroad, and spy on Muslim communities at home. His ludicrous threat to go after the Professional Golf Association for moving a tournament from one of his courses. This behavior evokes a tinpot dictator from some banana republic -- as rendered by The Onion. But Trump is the nominee of one of America's two major parties. So the press began to examine his one supposed qualification for the presidency -- his business career. Which, it transpired, was marbled with dishonesty, self -- dealing, and catastrophic failures of judgment for which others, but seldom Trump, paid the price. A favorite tactic was using the Trump name to pitch courses which have no actual value, in which Trump played no actual role. One such scam was "" Trump Institute,"" a supposed wealth creation seminar for which Trump claimed ""I'm teaching what I've learned."" In fact, Trump had nothing whatsoever to do with the course, whose real operators used plagiarized materials and were trailed by numerous charges of fraud and deceit. In the words of one participant: "" It was like I was in sleaze America. It was all smoke and mirrors.""  Thus Trump University -- a pastiche of shallow seminars to which Trump lent his imprimatur but, the sales pitch notwithstanding, no actual thought. He did not, as advertised, handpick instructors or concern himself with content, let alone provide ""priceless information"" to make his students wealthy. Instead Trump U was an exercise in hucksterism, in which salespeople pressured the economically vulnerable to enlist in his most costly form of worthless education -- the ""Gold Elite Program."" True, the Gold Elite Program is unavailable anywhere else -- like Harvard. All this might be funny save for the pressure on students to incur often crippling levels of debt so that Donald Trump could get a little richer. But preying on others has always been his modus operandi. In a devastating article, the New York Times explored Trump's history in Atlantic City. The short of it is this: He put in little of his own money. He borrowed excessively, at ruinously high interest rates. He shifted personal debts to his casinos. He collected millions in salary, bonuses and expenses. He took four trips to bankruptcy court. He stiffed investors, subcontractors and suppliers, ruining numerous small business people. His casinos lagged far behind the competition. His only gift, it seems, was for self- enrichment at the expense of others. As an analyst remarked: ""There's something not right when every single one of your projects doesn't work out."" Neither, when examined, would Trump's plans for the American economy. Moody's Analytics, a respected research firm, studied the main components of his economic program: enacting large tax cuts slanted toward the rich; deporting millions of undocumented workers; and imposing tariffs on Mexico and China. Assuming that a President Trump got his wish list, Moody's forecast a deep and lengthy recession; a 2.4% drop in gross domestic product; and a rise in unemployment to 7.4%. Add to this a $9.5 trillion drop in the revenues over decade; a ballooning deficit; and government borrowing at ever higher interest rates. Inevitably, inflation follows such disasters. But then nothing in Trump's business background had ever suggested that he knew anything about managing the world's largest economy. Or, for that matter, a political campaign. Trump's primary campaign, it turns out, was a political Potemkin village -- understaffed, financed on the cheap, and sustained by the gift of free media in unprecedented amounts. In the small world of Republican primary voters, this was enough to overwhelm a feckless field of opponents too busy sniping at each other to go after Donald Trump. A general election campaign is a different matter. So is Hillary Clinton. And Trump is monumentally unprepared to deal with either. Belatedly chartered to build an organizational and financial structure, professionals like Paul Manafort are digging out of a very deep hole. Trump's campaign structure is skeletal. His minimal staff is, for the most part, short on experience. He has little or no infrastructure in key states. His Super -PAC is feeble.  Conflict within the campaign continues -- new faces keep leaving shortly after being hired. Most recently, two members of Trump's surrogate team quit, one after having been publicly contradicted by Trump. Firing Corey Lewandowski solved nothing; the problem is Trump himself. And the primaries taught him nothing but what a narcissist will always believe: that Trump himself is enough. He has raised virtually no money. He barely tries. He repels donors. Unsurprisingly, more than $6 million in campaign money has gone to Trump businesses or to reimburse Trump and his family for expenses. The situation got so bad that, as June began, his campaign had but $1.3 million on hand. And so instead of campaigning in battleground states, he was forced through a gauntlet of emergency fund raisers in search of dollars to get up on the airwaves. In the last week, we have seen yet another attempt -- no doubt spurred by Manafort and company - to make Trump more sedate. As always, this effort was spotty -- he responded to the tragedy in Istanbul by calling for waterboarding and more elaborate forms of torture. And when he read from a script, he trashed decades of Republican economic dogma, excoriating NAFTA and the TPP, denouncing free trade in general, and promising a trade war with China.  Here, for the party, the problem was not that Trump was a text deviate but that, to the express horror of the Chamber of Commerce and other Republican pillars, he quite deliberately deviated from protecting their interests. The idea, of course, is that Trump can round up the votes of white working-class folks damaged by globalization. But this has its own problems. As the self-proclaimed protector of American workers, Trump must, as often, confront himself. His clothing and furniture products are made in countries he identifies as the enemy, like Mexico and China, and in the past he has exploited undocumented laborers. And, yet again, Trump exposed the rifts within the party, providing fresh evidence for the donor class -- some of whom still fantasized about exercising a modicum of control - that Frankenstein had escaped the lab.  In truth, Trump can never escape his own compulsions. Within a day, he once more veered sharply off script -- at a time when he desperately needs to consolidate party support by playing the statesman, he used a raucous campaign rally to lash out at former GOP rivals who have failed to support him, placing his personal grievances above all else. Surprise. As this was happening, the Clinton campaign was battering him in battleground states with millions of dollars in negative ads. The Trump campaign could afford no ads. As one bewildered operative remarked: ""It's political malpractice."" All this endangers Republican candidates in down ballot races, including for the Senate. To this Trump seems quite indifferent. Indeed -- wholly contrary to the behavior of a normal nominee -- Trump has suggested that he will leave the work of organizing in swing states to the already overtaxed Republican National Committee, further draining its resources. And so, at last, Reince Priebus is discovering how it feels to be a subcontractor for Donald Trump. Pity poor Priebus. Much like a Trump casino, his party is headed for Chapter 11. Two months in thrall to Trump have taken a serious toll. Trump's poll numbers are slipping - every national poll shows Trump trailing Clinton. To the GOP's dismay, the race is shaping up as a referendum on Trump. Perhaps partisan polarization will spare Republicans the worst. But the GOP may well be tethered to a dead man walking who, in his death throes, will drag the party into his own grave. Not, for Priebus, a cheerful thought. But the show must go on. The Republican national convention looms ahead -- zombie candidate or no. And what a show it promises to be. Trump boasts that his very own convention will reflect his gift for ""showbiz"". His main idea is for a ""winner's night"" of sports figures to speak on his behalf: Bobby Knight, who once physically attacked his own player; Ben Roethlisberger, formerly accused of sexual assault; and Tom Brady, who merely deflates footballs. This is partly driven by necessity -- even rising Republican politicians otherwise hungry for attention fear speaking at Trump's carnival in Cleveland. Such is the vacuum that Trump has proposed filling it with Sarah Palin, stretching nostalgia to the breaking point. So, like it or not, it's a fair bet that we'll be hearing from Trump's wife and kids. Indeed, at one point a Trump advisor suggested that The Donald himself might speak on all four nights. Faced with this, Apple joined a string of companies cutting or eliminating their financial support for the convention -- oddly, they seem uncomfortable underwriting the coronation of a race - baiting demagogue. Indeed, some Republican delegates are so appalled by this prospect that they are mounting a desperate bid to block him which, while doomed, will surely add to the entertainment. But the deeper meaning of all this is distinctly unamusing. For the convention will hold up a mirror to the GOP's division, dishonesty, incoherence and shame. To head off open dissent, Trump and Priebus have allied, admonishing delegates that repudiating their pledge to Trump violates party rules, and threatening to deny speaking slots to prominent officeholders - including John Kasich and Ted Cruz -- who do not endorse him. The question is whether that they can stifle opposition to Trump at whatever cost, reducing the convention to an ersatz version of the Soviet Comintern, or whether a principled minority will be free to express their conscience for the country to see. In his honorable opposition, Mitt Romney describes the stakes for his party and the country. Electing Trump, he said, could change the character of the country, licensing ""trickle-down racism,"" ""trickle-down misogyny,"" and ""trickle-down bigotry."" Like Romney, the last two Republican presidents -- the elder and younger Bush -- have refused to endorse their party's rogue nominee. So, too, numerous Republican governors, senators, representatives, consultants, commentators, and foreign policy analysts. Senator Mark Kirk stated but one of many compelling reasons: ""Donald Trump does not have the temperament to command our military or nuclear arsenal."" Whatever their more personal motives, these men and women are doing what is often discussed but little seen -- putting country before party. The Republican dilemma throughout the convention and beyond is that Trump was chosen, with a truly disturbing enthusiasm, by the party's base voters. And so most prominent Republicans have chosen to support him. Many barely mention his name. Instead they muster the most threadbare of excuses -- that they owe it to the country to stop Hillary Clinton from becoming president. And so they hope, not without reason, that they can use political polarization to stem off electoral disaster -- by adding to it. It is hard to describe how contemptible this is. Even viewed through the most partisan lens - GOP accusations of dishonesty, venality, poor judgment and bad policy choices -- Clinton falls within the normal parameters of past major party candidates. Not so Trump. In the history of presidential politics, he is a mutation -- shockingly ignorant, unwilling to learn, indifferent to fact, addicted to lies, blindingly self- absorbed, reckless in his behavior, wholly unpredictable, and gripped by a profound personal disorder which renders him not merely unfit, but an existential menace to the country. All the more shocking, then, is the GOP's Stockholm syndrome -- the effort to persuade themselves, and us, that through some mystical process this terminally unstable pretender can be channeled for the national good. Yet the GOP has already seen his unruly harbingers in prior races -- Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain. Here Republicans are captured in a black irony of contradictions: Trump is at once a nominee of unique and frightening incapacity, and the utterly predictable product of all the party has become. To advance the economic agenda of its donors, ideologues like Paul Ryan contravened the desires of the base, embracing free trade, tax cuts for the rich, slashes in entitlements, and an immigration policy congenial to commerce. To secure the votes of its most embattled loyalists, they substituted scapegoats -- government, minorities, welfare recipients and the godless. Their product was anger -- not hope, not inclusion and not, in truth, much compassion for anyone but those who financed the Republican party. On some level, people like Ryan and Priebus knew that this was a demographic cul-de-sac -- hence the post -- 2012 autopsy which argued for greater inclusiveness. But it was too late -- for too long, resentment of minorities had been a critical bridge to less fortunate whites. And then came Donald Trump to give the game away. He doubled down on xenophobia and racism directed at minorities -- Hispanics, Muslims and, with scarcely less subtlety, blacks. As deadly, he ripped the mask off the GOP establishment, attacking free trade and defending entitlements. And the base rose up to follow him with a full - throated roar. The Ryan agenda is comatose. The party's trafficking in tacit racism is now overt. Its nominee views its leaders with contempt. Its various factions are at war, their incompatibility exposed. Threadbare of credible ideas, the GOP has become a compendium of plutocrats, conspiracy theorists, free-market purists, climate change deniers, anti -- tax fanatics, gun nuts, racists, nativists, protectionists, fundamentalists and devotees of big oil, held together by dishonest rhetoric, diversionary attacks, and phony ""facts."" As malignant as he is, Trump is but a symptom. The disease lies deep within the GOP. That is why the party will still be sick long after Trump loses, a dead weight on the country which it has helped make sick at heart.",07/05/16

The 7 Types of Social Media 'Gurus' You'll Meet,"This isn't to say that all social media gurus have no idea what they're doing; on the contrary, most are skilled in the social media world. They just aren't all skilled in the same ways.",Business,HuffPost,"In the social media world, a disproportionately high number of users are actively describing themselves as ""gurus."" What is a social media guru? That depends on who you ask. The unfortunate truth is that ""guru"" is an intentionally vague term, and while it sounds both impressive and descriptive, it describes no actual specific function or role. This isn't to say that all social media gurus have no idea what they're doing; on the contrary, most are skilled in the social media world. They just aren't all skilled in the same ways. Take, for contrasting examples, these seven types of social media ""gurus,"" all of which have some claim to the term: 1. The Resume Buffer. The resume buffer is probably the least objectively skilled guru on this list. Sometimes straight out of college and sometimes just interested in finding new ways to look more attractive to a potential employer, the resume buffer adopts the title ""social media guru"" to look good in a professional context. They generally do have a reasonable familiarity with various popular platforms, which is admirable, but they don't have much knowledge about the science of AB tests or the importance of measuring and interpreting analytics. You can tell a resume buffer by asking a few simple questions--most of the time, resume buffers have no formal experience doing social media work for brands or personalities other than their own. 2. The Influencer. The influencer calls herself a guru because of the large following she's been able to develop. Influencers usually have access to an audience of thousands, accumulated over time by the sheer power of networking or through various online strategies she's adopted. Because of her large audience, each post she makes is valuable and can sway hundreds to thousands of people toward or away from a separate brand. However, building a large reputation for yourself is no guarantee you'll also be able to do that for someone else (or for a corporate brand). It could be her unique personality that allows her to accumulate such influence. 3. The Hard Seller. The hard seller calls himself a social media guru because of how much time he spends a day on a given platform. He is in some type of sales role, either serving as a salesman for a specific company or trying to promote himself as a worker. Because of this, he makes a lot of posts and knows how to measure audience responses, but he isn't too familiar with best practices for building relationships with followers. To be successful in the long-term, most businesses require a degree of soft relationship building in addition to some sales experience. 4. The Socialite. The socialite is also a ""guru"" by virtue of the amount of time she spends on various platforms, but instead of hard selling, she's just being herself. She's intimately familiar with all the parts and functions of each popular platform (and some off the mainstream), but she may not have a wide audience, and she may or may not post things that people like. Because of this, she can be said to have a high degree of skill when it comes to the technical use of these platforms, but little skill in relationship building or brand promotion. 5. The Marketer. The marketer is a social media guru all about building an audience. Similar to the hard seller, the marketer has a bottom line--get more people to a given website, or attract more followers to a brand. This is distinct because it's a softer, more relationship-focused skillset, and it doesn't manifest itself through sheer time spent on various platforms. Instead, the marketer usually makes his claim only after doing this work for multiple people or brands, giving him more experience and a more diverse skillset to take advantage of. 6. The Writer. The writer uses social media strictly as a means to promote her work. She may be on multiple platforms on a near-constant basis, or a handful of platforms only some of the time, but either way, she spends most of her time trying to promote her writing. This is beneficial, especially if she is skilled at it--a writing-based social media guru can easily rack up hundreds or thousands of followers in a readership, but it also means that her strategies and tactics are dependent on strong content to be successful. If you have strong content already, it could be a perfect match. 7. The Brand Ambassador. The brand ambassador is the most flexible and useful social ""guru"" on this list because his main skillset is adapting his skillset for whatever company or brand he's doing work for. For instance, he might focus on networking and building up a large audience for a personal brand, but rely on the power of content marketing for a corporate brand in a specific industry. Brand ambassadors typically call themselves gurus only after they've helped a number of other brands. The next time a social media guru reaches out to you offering help with your social media campaign, take inventory of what type of social media guru that person is. Being successful in social media requires access to many different skillsets, and not all businesses need the same type of guru to succeed. Know the diverse roles possible in the social media realm, and use those roles to your greatest advantage by finding the niche experts you specifically need.",10/28/15
A National Ban on Internet Gambling: Crony Capitalism at Work,Crony capitalism is epidemic. Federal regulation is chronically the carrier of the disease. A current example is the gold-plated endeavor fueled by family unfriendly casino magnates like Sheldon Adelson for a national prohibition of internet gambling under the counterfeit banner of morality.,Politics,HuffPost,"Crony capitalism is epidemic.  Federal regulation is chronically the carrier of the disease.  A current example is the gold-plated endeavor fueled by family unfriendly casino magnates like Sheldon Adelson for a national prohibition of internet gambling under the counterfeit banner of morality.  Shakespeare would have written, ""Hypocrisy, thy name is the Restoration of America's Wire Act!"" (RAWA).  Gambling is more a venial than venal sin.  It escapes Dante's nine circles of hell, which include lust, gluttony, and greed--all of which flourish freely under federal law. Neither Moses nor Jesus sermonized against gambling. It does not offend the Ten Commandments. On the scale of social utility, gambling ranks at least as high as the annual $250 billion fashion industry calculated to gratify narcissism and promote lust. Finding amusement in internet gambling is no less worthy of protection as a feature of personal liberty as is squandering fabulous sums on jewelry or tens of thousands of dollars on designer dresses.  Making allowance for the ordinary depravity of human nature, the Constitution wisely withheld from Congress the mission of setting moral norms. Think, for example, of the standards of morality set by former House Speakers Newt Gingrich, Robert Livingston, and Dennis Hastert, former House Members Anthony Weiner, Mark Foley, and Trey Radel, and Senator David Vitter. And they are only the tip of the iceberg. Prohibition required a constitutional amendment. But it was repealed as a dismal failure. It made smugglers and bootleggers rich. Federal law endorses various forms of gambling, such as horse racing, bingo games, or state lotteries. And Nevada enjoys special exceptions. Accordingly, a congressional ban on interstate gambling would be like the ""Never on Sunday"" prissiness of a strumpet.  There is a role for uniform federal rules in matters that concern fundamental rights of citizenship or equality, for example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, or the National Labor Relations Act. But RAWA is well outside that universe. It is a vestige of Blue laws and schoolmarm-like government in which the great fear is that someone, somewhere, may be enjoying himself.  Despite these considerations, the abject failure of Prohibition, and the futility of Savonarola's bonfire of the vanities, Congress is flirting with making internet gambling a federal offense and diverting the scarce resources of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from thwarting international terrorism to snaring internet users betting on the outcome of the next presidential election, the World Series or otherwise. This would return the FBI back to the bad old days when J. Edgar Hoover devoted more attention to interstate auto theft than to organized crime. I have worked in and out of all three branches of the federal government for nearly fifty years. I have walked in front of the White House to and from work on thousands of occasions. There, every type of both conceivable and inconceivable protests is commonplace. But I have yet to hear or see a single person urging the federal government to snuff out gambling--even the Amish.  So what explains the congressional interest? You guessed it. Crony capitalism featuring casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson.  He has contributed more than $100 million to Republican candidates and related organizations.  Chief sponsors of RAWA include Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).  Senator Graham has received handsome campaign contributions from Adelson. In early October, Senator Rubio, a candidate in the 2016 presidential sweepstakes, held a meeting in Adelson's offices at the Venetian Las Vegas, to curry his support. Mimicking the role of the Music Man worrying about vice in River City, Adelson has asserted to Politico, ""When I started to imagine what would happen with legalized Internet gaming, it scared the heck out of me ... because of what's it's going to do to our society [i.e, his bank account]. ... I'm concerned about college students. They are of age, and I'm concerned about poor people who really can't afford to do it, that we're putting all these temptations smack on their kitchen table."" But does Adelson think we don't' know that even the devil can quote scripture? RAWA should die an unmourned death. The FBI has better things to do than to chase down internet gamblers.",11/02/15
Dismissing the Notion of Insubordination,"In a recent article in Acoustic Guitar, Adam Perlmutter chronicles the unusual career path of Dick Boak, one of Martin Guitar's most creative luthiers.",Business,HuffPost," by Rod Collins, Director of Innovation at Optimity Advisors In a recent article in Acoustic Guitar, Adam Perlmutter chronicles the unusual career path of Dick Boak, one of Martin Guitar's most creative luthiers. Today Boak is the historian-in-residence of the 183-year old company and one of the most respected craftsman in his profession, but his entrée and advancement in the revered company is an intriguing and unconventional tale. Boak was enamored with music and woodmaking at an early age. He began making little instruments in his basement when he was 12 from balsa wood he would purchase at a local hobby shop. His artistic bent expanded when he became fascinated with the visual arts while attending Gettysburg College in eastern Pennsylvania. After dropping out of college in the late 1960's, the self-described hippie worked a series of odd jobs as an illustrator working his way cross-country where he settled in a commune in a rural area outside of San Francisco. By the mid-1970's, Boak made his way back to Pennsylvania working as a performing artist and dabbling in lutherie when an act of trespassing would turn into a life-changing event. An Unusual Hiring . . . And Firing  Boak would routinely skulk behind the Nazareth, Pennsylvania headquarters of Martin Guitar and rummage through their dumpsters for discarded wood. One day he was caught by a foreman who wanted to know what he was doing with the wood. Boak reached into his car and handed over two instruments. The foreman told him to stay put while he summoned the head of the company, C.F. Martin III, who was so impressed with the budding luthier's creativity that he hired him on the spot. Having had years of unsteady work, Boak appeared to have settled into his calling as he quickly developed a reputation as an innovative and creative luthier. When the CEO of the company hires you and everyone loves your work, you would certainly think job security would not be a problem. This would not be so for Boak because, at the end of his first year, he was abruptly fired. Like so many companies of its time and most companies today, Martin Guitar was structured as a top-down hierarchy, and while the CEO may have hired him, the CEO was not Boak's direct boss. After Boak had joined the guitar company, Martin hired an engineer who became his supervisor. Boak had been working on the design of the components for a new banjo model when his boss instructed him to move one of the joints in the design. Boak argued that repositioning the joint would cause the banjo to break, but the engineer refused to listen and ordered him to make the design modification. Regardless, Boak was convinced the relocation of the joint would cost the company tens of thousands of dollars. He couldn't sit idly by and let this design error go forward, so he reported his concern to the personnel manager. The following morning, Boak was fired by his boss with a stern rebuke for violating one of the prime rules of hierarchical management: Never go over the boss's head. Creativity Wins Back a Dream Job Boak was stunned and crushed that his dream job was suddenly gone. Deep down he felt this was wrong. After all, why should you lose your job when you're acting in the best interests of the company? Why should following orders be more important than getting it right?  Landing this dream job had been a long journey, and Boak decided he was not going to simply give in. He would go over the boss's head once again, but this time in a very creative way. He drew a limited edition of signed pen-and-ink prints of Martin's acclaimed D-28 model, and personally delivered one to C.F. Martin III with the inscription, ""Please consider this my reapplication for employment."" Martin was delighted with the print and appalled to discover that Boak had been terminated. Martin immediately rehired Boak, eventually assigning him to produce designs for the factory gift shop where the fruits of his efforts resulted in a tenfold increase in sales. Boak would go on to become Martin Guitar's director of artist and public relations and develop the lucrative Signature Editions line of guitars. As for Boak's former boss, he was dismissed a few years after Boak was rehired when a spike in broken banjo rims resulting from the joint design modification created a major quality issue for the company. Dick Boak was fortunate that Martin Guitar was not a typical large corporation where his creative reapplication would have likely fallen on deaf ears. That's because, while C.F. Martin & Company may appear to be hierarchically organized, it has always been and remains today a family-owned business dedicated to providing a workplace with open communications and promoting a safe environment of teamwork and cooperation. C.F. Martin III's rehiring of Boak demonstrates that the company's core values were not empty words but guiding principles for how to lead a company. The Foundational Principle For Creating a Great Work Culture Dick Boak's story highlights an important foundational principle for business leaders who are serious about creating a great work culture: No single individual should have the authority to kill a good idea or to keep a bad idea alive. This is the key guidepost for the new peer-to-peer network management architecture that is increasingly becoming the preferred management structure among today's most innovative enterprises. While Boak was not a highly educated engineer, he was a skilled craftsman who knew how to build stringed instruments, and most importantly, he was right in his concern that the joint modification would create a financial loss. Yet, in this case, Boak's engineer supervisor assumed he had the authority to make a unilateral decision and to mute the craftsman's voice because that's the way the world of hierarchical management works. In the typical hierarchical organization, the operating rule of thumb is clearly understood: Keep your mouth shut and do what you're told. A Dangerous Rule of Thumb Unfortunately, this rule of thumb can be very dangerous because, if the most knowledgeable voices can be systematically silenced, the organization is, by design, embracing structured ignorance. Were there people inside Kodak or Blockbuster who knew their companies' strategies and assumptions were fatally flawed, but had no way to bring their insights forward for fear of termination? What might have happened to the fate of these once corporate giants if their fundamental organizing principle prevented anyone from killing a good idea or keeping a bad idea alive? We can only imagine. Even though C.F. Martin III did the right thing in bringing Boak back into the company family, he failed to take the step of implementing Boak's recommendation on the placement of the banjo joint. While this lack of action was not a fatal flaw in this instance, hopefully Martin Guitar has learned from this experience and would handle a similar situation differently today.  Avoiding Structured Ignorance As counterintuitive as it may seem, one of the most important--if not the most important--step a business can take to make sure it sustains high performance is to limit the authority of the bosses. If your organization has legions of supervisors--all of whom have the authority to silence their employees under the threat of termination for insubordination--then it's probably just a matter of time before structured ignorance creates a difficult, and hopefully not fatal, business crisis. There are companies who understand this counterintuitive wisdom and avoid structured ignorance by dismissing the very notion of insubordination. For example, when Chris Rufer founded Morning Star, the world's largest tomato processor, 45 years ago, he structured his company on two foundational principles: No one person should have the authority to coerce another person, and all individuals should keep their commitments to the company mission. With this in mind, Rufer designed his organization as a peer-to-peer network without any supervisors, where individual workers negotiate specific commitments with their colleagues and measure the status of these commitments on a bi-weekly basis. Without bosses, insubordination is not possible, and, with bi-weekly measures, the necessary transparency exists to allow anyone in the company to highlight something that might cost the company tens of thousands of dollars. Google is another example of a company that avoids structured ignorance by making it difficult for its supervisors to micromanage and creating a space where it's safe not to follow orders. The ratio of employees to supervisors at Google can be as high as 60 to 1, making it difficult for bosses to hover over people's shoulders. And the technology company's well-known 20 percent time makes sure that no one has the authority to kill a good idea by providing employees with time where they are free to work on anything they want, even if it's contrary to direction given in their regular work. What Morning Star and Google both appreciate is that work cultures are most innovative and productive when there is the free flow of both information and ideas, which is why they dismiss the notion of insubordination.

The Most Disastrous Investment Decision You Can Make,,Business,HuffPost,"I recently had a sad experience that caused me to refocus my attention. A widow asked for my advice. Her husband had died suddenly in his mid-sixties. He had no life insurance. The couple lived ""within their means"", but had little in savings. She had one overriding question: Could she stay in the family home? I told her I didn't see how she could afford to do so. In fact, it was likely she would have to return to work. Massive underinsurance According to a survey conducted by Nationwide Financial, the average U.S. life insurance policy covers only about 16% of the lifetime earnings of the insured. Only 2% of those surveyed had sufficient life insurance. Reasons for underinsurance There are many reasons for this insurance gap. Here are the big ones: Cost: Obtaining sufficient life insurance may cost less than you believe. According to Nationwide, a $99 monthly payment over 20 years would give a healthy 35-year old $2.3 million of life insurance. Denial: Few want to confront their own mortality. Yet, it's irrefutable that we're all going to die. The data indicates women are four times more likely than men to be widowed. Have you really thought about what would happen to your spouse when you die? Hypocrisy: I hear couples affirming their love for each other. It's touching, but it can also be hypocritical. If you really love your spouse, you'll consider the impact of your death and act in a fiscally responsible way to insure the quality of life of the surviving spouse. Life insurance is a critical component of your financial planning. Ignoring it is both hypocritical and irresponsible. Bad advice: If you are using a broker or an advisor who charges a fee based on assets under management, be aware that recommending life insurance reduces those assets. Consciously or otherwise, it may not be at the top of the list of financial planning suggestions. Registered Investment Advisors have a fiduciary obligation to always act in your best interest. They should be sure you have adequate life insurance as part of the holistic planning process. If they don't, raise this issue with them. Confusion: Unfortunately, life insurance is one of the most confusing products available. Some throw up their hands and simply ignore the need. This is a huge mistake, with potentially disastrous consequences. For many, an inexpensive term policy is the best option. A reliable source of information from a highly rated company is TIAA-CREF. You can deal with them online or on the phone. My understanding is they are not commission based. I have no association with this firm or with any other insurance or advisory entity. Distraction: When is the last time CNBC did a feature story on the need for life insurance? The big money in the wealth management business is generating fees or commissions derived from managing your assets. The reality is that most Americans are terrible investors, earning returns that don't even keep up with the rate of inflation. Americans also are not great savers.  By some estimates, the average American saves less than 5% of disposable income. The combination of low savings, poor investment returns, massive advertising by the securities industry and the failure to confront our mortality, is the perfect storm for spouses. No wonder becoming a widow is ""an important risk factor for transition into poverty,"" according to a report on the web page of the Social Security Office of Policy. It's time to step up and do the right thing. Check your life insurance coverage. If there's a gap, fill it. Procrastination is not a viable plan. The views of the author are his alone.

Action to Achieve Inclusive Capitalism by Roger Martin,"For the past quarter century, capitalism in the advanced economies has moved forward in an impressive but not inclusive fashion. The winners are clear. First, it is industries that trade outside of their own local area, such as pharmaceuticals or software.",Business,HuffPost,"Roger Martin Institute Director, Martin Prosperity Institute, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto For the past quarter century, capitalism in the advanced economies has moved forward in an impressive but not inclusive fashion. The winners are clear. First, it is industries that trade outside of their own local area, such as pharmaceuticals or software. These innovate and upgrade in order to compete broadly and achieve large scale. They have prospered relative to dispersed industries, such as local banking or healthcare provision, that don't trade outside their own area. Second, it is workers who are asked to use their creativity to engage in independent judgment and decision making at work. Such workers have high job security and have experienced healthy wage growth. This is in stark comparison to those who are asked to carry out routine intensive, repetitive tasks who not only feel intense wage pressure but also have little or no job security.  In combination, the very biggest winners are creative workers in traded industries. This fortunate 13.9% of the American workforce earns a 78.5% premium over the national average - a premium that has grown smartly from 74.0% in 2000. At the other end of the scale are routine workers in local industries. They make up by far the biggest category of U.S. employment at 44.8% of workers. Their wages are low and falling further behind: in 2000, they earned 31.7% less than the U.S. national average and by 2014 the gap had widened to 36.8%. Capitalism gives the former group a warm and lucrative embrace while the latter gets the cold shoulder. In order to produce a more broadly inclusive capitalism, we need to see a transformation in how work is structured and valued. The economy can't depend solely on the slow substitution of creative jobs for routine jobs. The creative content of routine jobs must be enhanced. Currently, there is a self-fulfilling prophecy in the routine sector of the economy. If employers discourage or prohibit independent judgment and decision-making, jobs become and remain routine jobs where low pay is commensurate with the low ability of the employee to create value in these conditions. These low-paid, low-skill jobs then cannot attract the kind of applicant that would have the skills to upgrade the job, setting in motion a vicious cycle. If instead, employers purposefully create workplace environments that promote employee judgment and decisionmaking, even seemingly routine jobs can and will become more creativity-intensive. This, in turn, will improve productivity and enable the employer to pay higher wages. Ultimately, it will attract better talent to these positions, creating a virtuous circle. In this way, the creativity-intensity of routine jobs will increase and indeed hasten the replacement of routine jobs with creative jobs. While there are undoubtedly those who would argue that this is impossible - believing that routine jobs will always be routine jobs - history shows that leading companies have won in their industries in part by encouraging independent judgment and decision-making from employees who would be seen and treated as routine workers in competitor companies. Take Toyota, Four Seasons, QuikTrip, Trader Joes, Whole Foods and Costco. These companies have made it a central feature of their strategies to provide workers with more decision-making authority and more opportunities to display independent judgment. They have also paid commensurately higher wages. The result is a virtuous circle of higher wages, higher sales, lower employee turnover, superior customer service, improved productivity, and striking competitive success. This is the fastest and most productive way forward for the U.S. economy: the transformation of a routine intensive exclusionary economy into a more inclusive, creativity-intensive one.",09/05/16
International Trade: The New Frontier for Hispanic Business,"America is home to more than 53 million Hispanics, and we play a critical role in supporting our nation's economy and way of life. To ensure the continued prosperity of our families and businesses, we must explore new frontiers for growth. One of those frontiers is the administration's bipartisan trade agenda.",Business,HuffPost," America is home to more than 53 million Hispanics, and we play a critical role in supporting our nation's economy and way of life. To ensure the continued prosperity of our families and businesses, we must explore new frontiers for growth. One of those frontiers is the administration's bipartisan trade agenda.  Today, there are 3.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses in America, that contribute more than $486 billion to our economy each year. Hispanic businesses are the fastest-growing segment of the small-business sector, with a start-up rate three times the national average. This should not come as a surprise--our cultural ties, language skills, and agility give us a competitive edge in today's globalized economy. These qualities uniquely position Hispanic-owned businesses to take the international stage, where 95 of the consumer market lives. President Obama's trade agenda has the support of both parties, and will ensure that our businesses, most of which are small and medium sized enterprises, are on a level playing field with their counterparts in other countries as they explore expansion opportunities. While many assume that exporting is limited to big businesses, the reality is that 98 percent of our 300,000 exporters are small businesses. Of these, minority firms are more likely than non-minority firms to have businesses generating 100 percent of all their sales in exports.  At the same time, less than 5 percent of all U.S. businesses export, and more than half of those exporters sell only to one market abroad. Clearly, there is untapped potential. This is the very potential that this trade agenda will bring into reach. At the forefront of this ambitious agenda is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, a multi-lateral agreement which aims to boost trade between the US and other countries including Mexico, Chile, and Peru, along with eight other countries in the Asia-Pacific. This landmark agreement will be the first to include a chapter dedicated to small and medium sized businesses.  TPP will lower tariffs to make sure that our small businesses do not face unfair barriers in foreign markets. For example, it will cut red tape that our businesses face; and make it easier to sell goods on the Internet. All of these factors will make small- and medium-sized businesses more competitive, improve our customers' happiness and loyalty, and create opportunities for us to expand operations at home as well. By giving companies, both big and small, the access and tools they need to expand and grow, TPP and other free trade agreements will create or support hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs--of special interest to Hispanic Americans, who are suffering from higher unemployment than the national average. Every $1 billion of U.S. exports supports over 5,000 jobs. And it's not just the number of jobs that matters. What matters is creating more jobs that Americans want: jobs that pay better and last longer. Those are exactly the types of jobs that trade supports. Export-related jobs pay up to 18 percent more than non export-related jobs, and they are less affected by economic downturns. As President & CEO of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, I am committed to helping American businesses make the most of these opportunities. I want our companies to have the resources they need to thrive, and even better, encourage Hispanic entrepreneurs to further contribute to our nation's economic renewal.  We call on Congress to enact Trade Promotion Authority, and support the administration's proposed free trade agreements. Together, our nation's business leaders and elected officials can usher in the next chapter of international trade. With the right policies and proper skills in place, our business men and women will ensure that America continues to out-compete, out-build, and out-innovate the rest of the world. All we need is Congress and the administration to act.",03/06/15
Organizational Success and Culture,"What I have come to appreciate is that no management structure or style is certain to result in business success but organizational cultures that encourage initiative, innovation and creativity are more effective than those cultures based on control.",Business,HuffPost,"My passion and love of business began as a young child. My father, a Cuban political refugee, was a serial entrepreneur. Despite his best efforts, none of his business ventures ever achieved any commercial success, but his journey sparked in me an immense desire to understand how successful businesses are structured and managed. What I have come to appreciate is that no management structure or style is certain to result in business success but organizational cultures that encourage initiative, innovation and creativity are more effective than those cultures based on control.  Working with my father provided me an opportunity to observe him regularly interacting with employees. He adopted a command and control management structure coupled with a patriarchal management style to operate his business. I don't think this was an intentional decision but like many new and less experienced entrepreneurs, organizational culture isn't usually a factor considered by the entrepreneur when determining how to build a successful enterprise. Instead, organizational cultures are often a byproduct of necessity driven by the demands of the business coupled with the leader's personal value system. For example, many businesses identify the work which needs to done and hire employees to do the work. The leader's expectation is that employees do the work they want done when they want it done. My father was no different, in that he expected employees to do exactly as they were told and not to question his instructions simply because he was the boss. He determined what work needed to be done based on customer demands and his expectation was that employees did as they were told.  It is commonplace for leaders to choose management structures and styles that align with their own value systems. Like my father, many leaders possess a value system where the person at the top makes all the decisions and everyone else has to simply conform or risk losing their job. This is especially common in small businesses and start-ups where the leader's livelihood is directly connected to the organization's performance. In these cultures, leaders are fearful of losing their livelihood and use the same fear to lead their employees. So, it is not surprising that so many of us have experienced unjust and inequitable working conditions in command and control cultures where leaders use fear and aggression as the means to drive employee productivity.  A few years ago, I worked for a company, the CEO, fearful that she would lose her livelihood, routinely bullied some employees and favored others. By favoring employees, she sought to gain the loyalty of those employees she liked and perceived to be productive so they would continue to work for her. By bullying employees she sought to use fear to improve employee productivity. Though bullied employees continued to do the job they were hired to perform, the level and quality of their performance was low because they were constantly coping with being bullied.  Interestingly enough, the favored employees were also unproductive because they were coping with the abuse they routinely witnessed by their CEO. The favored employees felt helpless because they could not protect their co-workers from the CEO's abusive treatment. The CEO created a habitual cycle of bullying and low performance. The net result of the CEO's management structure and style was employees felt no loyalty to her and spent much of their time consoling one another instead of working. Eventually, the very thing she was trying to protect, her livelihood, was lost. Would she have saved her own job had she opted for a different organizational structure or a nicer management style?  By contrast, another company I worked for also used the command and control management structure but the President's management style was a mixture of laissez faire and complacency. Like the CEO who bullied employees, this President also feared losing his livelihood, but instead of bullying employees, his leadership style was to build personal loyalty by being nice. He seemed to operate under the assumption that leaders who hold their employees accountable were not nice. As a result, employees were rarely held accountable and employee productivity and loyalty was low to non-existent. Though, today this company still exists, the President's complacency has positioned the company in a downward financial trajectory, and time is its inevitable demise.  Though, historically, the command and control management structure and its many iterations of management styles has been successfully used by many companies, there is evidence that organizational cultures based on value systems that reward initiative, creativity and innovation result in greater employee productivity, loyalty and engagement than cultures based on control. In other words, organization's that adopt command and control management structures, even when coupled with friendlier management styles, are likely to find that employee productivity, engagement and loyalty are not as high as those organizational cultures that encourage initiative, creativity and innovation.  An organization's culture should not be a byproduct of necessity but instead be viewed as a means to increase the chances of an organization's success. Next time you are considering how to improve your organization's chance of success, ask yourself, what a successful business culture looks like and head in that direction.

Ten Tips For Generating Higher Returns,"The first quarter of this year has ended. How were your returns? Since short-term returns are not very meaningful for a long-term financial plan, perhaps a better question is: How have your returns been over the past one, three, five and 10 years?",Business,HuffPost,"The first quarter of this year has ended. How were your returns? Since short-term returns are not very meaningful for a long-term financial plan, perhaps a better question is: How have your returns been over the past one, three, five and 10 years? If you are unhappy with your returns, I have some suggestions for you. They are based on solid, peer-reviewed research. You are unlikely to get this advice from your broker. 1. Don't try to find mispriced stocks  Approximately 60 million trades take place daily in the world's stock markets. The dollar volume of this daily trading is $302 billion. The best reflection of fair market prices for a stock is the price buyers and sellers set and reset every minute of the day. These prices are likely to be fair, based on all available information at the time. The odds of finding mispriced stocks are exceedingly small. Don't try. 2. Don't try to pick an outperforming mutual fund For the 15-year period ending Dec. 31, 2014, of the 2,711 U.S. equity mutual funds in existence at the beginning of it, only 42 percent survived the entire time. Only 19 percent of those funds that survived outperformed their benchmarks. If you are trying to pick a mutual fund likely to outperform, the odds are stacked against you. 3. Don't rely on past performance Here's the bottom line on past performance: It doesn't persist. At the beginning of the 10-year period ending Dec. 31, 2009, there were 2,711 U.S. equity mutual funds in existence. Of that number, 25 percent (682 funds) outperformed their benchmarks. How did those funds do in the subsequent period from 2010-2014? Only 28 percent repeated their prior stellar performance.  The Securities and Exchange Commission got it right when it required mutual funds to state that past performance is not predictive of future results. It isn't. Yet, mutual funds still advertise their past performance and many investors rely on it when selecting investments prospectively. Don't be one of them. 4. Accept market returns I don't understand why so many investors are consumed with ""beating the market."" Pursuing this goal makes it more likely you will earn less than market returns. What's wrong with embracing market returns? If you invested one dollar in 1927 in a U.S. large-cap index fund, your investment would have grown to $3,955 by 2014.  Your new investment goal should be to capture the returns of the global market. 5. Understand the real drivers of returns Many investors believe the factors that affect their returns are stock picking, market timing and mutual fund selection. Here's what really drives your returns: Stocks The allocation of your portfolio between stocks and bonds is a primary determinant of your expected returns. Historically, stocks have returned a premium over bonds. The size of the companies in your stock portfolio impacts your returns. Historically, small-cap stocks have higher returns than the stocks of large companies. Value stocks have historically had higher returns than growth companies. High-profitability companies tend to have higher returns than low-profitability companies. Bonds Longer-term bonds historically have had higher yields than shorter-maturity bonds. Bonds with lower credit quality historically have had higher yields than bonds with higher credit quality. Most investors would benefit from retaining a competent registered investment advisor who understands how to design a suitable portfolio utilizing these drivers of returns. 6. Globally diversify Many investors suffer from what is known as ""home country bias,"" which means they overweight their portfolio in the stocks of the country where they reside. A globally diversified portfolio helps reduce risks without lowering expected returns.  7. Don't try to pick outperforming segments Remember your new goal? It's to capture the returns of the global market. It's almost impossible to predict which market segments will outperform from year to year. Don't try. 8. Invest like Mr. Spock The legendary Star Trek character had no emotions. This permitted him to make decisions based solely on objective data. Many investors react emotionally to the gyrations of the market, causing them to buy high and sell low. You can't be a responsible investor until you get control of your emotions. 9. Ignore the headlines If you are saving for retirement, why are you concerned about what's going on with the market today? Much of the financial media stokes investor anxiety. Acting on that anxiety may result in activity that will enrich your broker at your expense. Your focus should remain on the long term. Ignore the financial news. 10. Focus on factors you can control Tomorrow's news drives stock prices. Neither you nor anyone else knows what tomorrow's news will be. Instead of focusing on factors you can't control, concentrate on those you can. These include your asset allocation, structuring a portfolio that takes into account the real drivers of expected returns, broad diversification, low expenses, low trading costs and minimizing taxes. If you implement these 10 tips, you will markedly increase your chances of improving your investment experience.

5 Phrases Every Leader Should Overuse,"One of the hardest roles to fill is being a leader of a start-up. You have to deal with never ending issues. Start-up CEOs must motivate the rest of the team, establish a company culture, and find a way to keep everyone together.",Business,HuffPost,"One of the hardest roles to fill is being a leader of a start-up. You have to deal with never ending issues. Start-up CEOs must motivate the rest of the team, establish a company culture, and find a way to keep everyone together. When stepping into a leadership position, it's easy to become overwhelmed. To help, there are five phrases that you should repeat as often as possible. Use these phrases as a guideline in decision-making, and you'll become much more effective as a leader. 1. ""I Trust Your Judgment"" When your team members are facing hard decisions, there are plenty of times that they will come to you looking for a solution. While your natural tendency will be to tell your team what to do, it is better to let them make decisions themselves. It is your responsibility to help your team grow, and you prevent it from growing if you always have the final say in everything.  2. ""I Don't Know"" As people step into leadership roles, there is pressure for them to act like they know everything. Many times, leaders will push an idea on their team or convince themselves that they have to know the answer to everything. This is a disastrous way to lead a company. As a leader, you have to be the first one to admit that you do not know everything. Members of your team will feel scared that by admitting they're unsure of something they are doing something wrong. This not only prevents them from improving, but also builds a company culture that won't allow people to make mistakes. When you show that it's ok to not know the answer to everything, your team will have much better communication and trust. 3. ""What Did We Learn From This?"" Being a leader is a roller coaster ride, especially in a start-up. One day your company is booming and the next you're almost out of business. Mistakes are happening and many times your team is facing obstacles for the first time. As the leader, when things go sour it is your job to make sure your team is taking full advantages of its failures. Instead of getting angry with team members, take a step back and ask your team what they've learned from their mistakes. Don't answer this question for them. Instead, give your team time to think about what the root cause of the problem was, and how to prevent it the next time. When you do this, you not only prevent future mistakes, but you also keep your team motivated to take future risks. 4. ""I'll Take Care Of It"" The ideal situation for a leader is to recruit a team where every member is smarter than him/her. Then when faced with tough decisions, they can delegate to the best person on the team. With that said, there are times where you will be the only one on the team that can take care of a problem. When these situations occur, you need to tell your team you'll handle the problem, and you do whatever it takes to execute. Start-ups are anything but stable, which is why as the leader you have to be the one person that everyone on the team can rely on. Delegate as much as possible, but when team needs you to come up big, step into the role, and make sure you take care of business. 5. ""We're All In This Together."" There's a lot of advice for how leaders should overcome failures. There's not enough written about how you should also celebrate success. Being the leader of a company is a double-edged sword. When your company fails at something, usually the outside finger is pointing at you. Even worse, when your team succeeds, people will try to say it's because of you that your team won. This is one of worst beliefs a leader can have. If you watch interviews of Steve Jobs, you'll notice how many times he attributes Apple's success to his team. While no one will make a movie about every employee at Apple, Jobs knew he would have never been successful without his team. When your team accomplishes something, remind your team members that it's the team that got you to where you are not just the leader. You win together and you fail together. That's how you build a great company.",11/13/15
The Business Payoff of Exercise,"Employers are beginning to understand the positive impact that employee wellbeing has on business. Greater worker engagement, increased productivity, fewer sick days, greater job satisfaction, increased worker concentration and reduced turnover all affect the bottom line.",Business,HuffPost,"By Joe Moore, President & CEO, International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (IHRSA); and Kenneth Thorpe, Ph.D., Chairman, Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease (PFCD), Robert W. Woodruff Professor and Chair, Department of Health Policy & Management, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University Employers are beginning to understand the positive impact that employee wellbeing has on business. And it's not just healthcare savings they're realizing. Greater worker engagement, increased productivity, fewer sick days, greater job satisfaction, increased worker concentration, easier recruitment, and reduced turnover all affect the bottom line.  As forward-thinking employers turn their attention to the total wellbeing of their employees, there are a few things that America's businesses need to know about the ROI of regular exercise and movement in the workplace. After all, when workers exercise, employers reap the rewards.  Take job performance as a prime example. When workers exercise three times a week for 30 minutes or more, it's 15 percent more likely that their job performance will be higher. And research suggests that when they exercise during regular work hours, its impact on performance may be even greater. In fact, one study found that when employees exercise during the workday, their mood and performance improves, along with their concentration, work relationships and resilience to stress.  The significant boost that exercise gives to employee engagement is especially important. All told, research shows that employee engagement helps business. In fact, employees who are most engaged (top quartile) have 37 percent lower absenteeism, 21 percent higher productivity, and 22 percent higher profitability when compared to those least engaged (bottom quartile), Gallup research has found.  Recognizing the business importance of motion in the workplace, C-suite executives across the country are signing onto the CEO Pledge for Physical Activity--a national campaign calling on every CEO in America to recognize physical activity as an important driver of employee health and business performance. They recognize that creating a culture of physical activity and wellness in the workplace requires their support.  Take for example, the commitment to wellbeing of the global cosmetics company Mary Kay Inc., a signer of the CEO Pledge. Not only does Mary Kay promote the wellbeing of women in greater society by sponsoring programs that help them overcome cancer and domestic violence, but it has shown a strong commitment to a comprehensive workplace wellbeing program as well. Along with company initiatives to improve employee health and wellbeing, Mary Kay has onsite fitness facilities, onsite health clinics, blood pressure kiosks, healthy restaurant options, and a smoking cessation program. Mary Kay also has a strong team of Global Wellness Ambassadors, which includes their CEO, to help encourage and promote a culture of wellbeing throughout Mary Kay's global locations.   Other organizations are leading the way as well. Several years ago, the owner of Northstar Ceramics brought an elliptical machine into its Dallas warehouse. After seeing him use it for one week, employees became inspired and tried it too. In response, the company built a dedicated exercise area in the middle of the warehouse and started bringing in a personal trainer to work with employees on site. Now, under new ownership and a new company name--StyleAccess--the corporate commitment to employee wellbeing continues.  From reducing the risk of worker burnout and depression, to enhancing self-efficacy and how workers feel about their ability to juggle the work-life balance, promoting regular exercise in the workplace yields rewards all around.   In an era when American businesses are struggling under the unrelenting demands that today's competitive economy puts on employee and corporate energy, incorporating regular movement and exercise into the workday really should be a business imperative.  Ultimately, a company's employees are its most valuable asset. When they thrive, so does the bottom line.",11/11/15
The Enemy Within,,Politics,HuffPost,"Once again the United States has suffered a terrorist attack. On November 2, a man in Des Moines, Iowa gunned down two police officers as they sat in their squad cars. The alleged perpetrator is in custody. So who is he?--a Muslim with sworn allegiance to ISIS?; a Syrian refugee?; an illegal Mexican immigrant? No, he is a White American, born and raised in the United States.  Considerable evidence suggests that Scott Michael Greene had embraced White supremacist ideology. Just a few weeks ago he had a run-in with police when he showed up at a high school football game displaying a Confederate flag to taunt African American spectators. According to neighbors, he placed a Trump sign on his lawn. With all the hype over international terrorism and the anti-immigrant rhetoric that some candidates have spewed this election season, it is important to remember the persistent threat posed by right-wing extremists. Experts disagree as to whether Islamists or domestic hate groups have killed and injured more Americans since 9/11. Much depends on how one defines terrorism, but the totals are at the very least nearly equal.  Based on their numbers alone, however, domestic extremists pose the greater threat. There is only one ISIS but 892 active hate groups according to the Southern Poverty Law Institute. Many of these groups are very heavily armed. In addition to their own members, they have numerous fellow travelers. Lone wolves like Greene and Dylan Roof, the young man who murdered 9 African Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina Church in June 2015 embraced their extremist ideology. People may wonder why an avowed racist would murder white officers. White supremacists not only hate people of color, they oppose what they see as government overreach. Some are ""sovereign citizens,"" individuals who claim they do not answer to government authority. Greene allegedly posted a video claiming that police had violated his civil rights by not allowing him to display the Confederate Flag at the football game. Whether this incident sparked his murderous rampage has yet to be determined.  Those wishing to downplay this threat from the far right insist that attacks like the ones in Iowa and South Carolina are isolated incidents perpetrated by disturbed individuals. The same critics will not, however, apply that argument to Omar Mateen, the equally disturbed perpetrator of the Orlando night club massacre. ""Greene and Roof were just sick, but Mateen was a cold blooded ISIS killer,"" they maintain. When the perpetrator belongs to your own group, you explain his actions away. When he belongs to a group you don't like, you see him as typical of that group. We need to pay as much attention to the enemy within as we do to the threat from without.",11/04/16
My Dad and Chuck Schumer,"Schumer and other renegade Democrats opposing their president have talking points filled with nuclear jargon. But no matter how they spin it, they are claiming that Democratic foreign policy leaders who they support on every other subject are wrong -- and that Dick Cheney, and the Republican presidential candidates are right.",Politics,HuffPost,"My father, Victor Goldberg was in 195th Field Artillery Battalion during World War Two, landing on Utah Beach nine days after D-Day. Like other members of his unit he was given Battle stars for being in five bloody battles against the Nazis in Normandy. Later he was among those American troops who liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.  For the last several years before he passed away my Dad and I would watch the political TV shows every Sunday and talk about the issues of the week. He would have been deeply saddened by the announcement this past week of opposition to the Iran deal by Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Nita Lowey, two ostensibly liberal Jewish Democrats whom he had supported and voted for. He was an FDR liberal. He loved Israel and he had a bias in favor of Jewish politicians because he felt a kinship with them. At the same time, from personal experience he knew the horrors of war. He believed in war only as a last resort and he would have loved President Obama's speech at American University laying out the rationale for the deal. Schumer and other renegade Democrats opposing their president have talking points filled with nuclear jargon. But no matter how they spin it, they are claiming that Democratic foreign policy leaders who they support on every other subject are wrong -- and that Dick Cheney, and the Republican presidential candidates are right. The most likely explanation for Schumer's behavior is that as someone whose public and private identity has been so supportive of Israel he has been influenced by the implacable opposition to the deal by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Schumer, Lowey, Brad Sherman and other Jewish Democrats who are opposing the president seem oblivious to the fact that Likud propagandists have tried to create a radically different definition of the phrase ""pro-Israel"" from what it meant in the first half century after the war against the Nazis. For decades the defining ""pro-Israel"" issues at the Congressional level were foreign aid and military support to help defend Israel. For many Americans, especially Jews like my Dad; there was a powerful post-Holocaust obligation to the Jewish people. Israel also supported American goals in the cold war and in the oil economy. But after Netanyahu became Prime Minister, he tried to transform the definition of ""pro-Israel"" to include a much larger influence of the overall foreign policy of the United States, a radical departure from previous Israeli regimes. This became vividly clear during the debate leading up to the Iraq War. American acolytes of Netanyahu and his party were stridently supportive of President Bush in pursuit of that disastrous mistake. In 1996, five years before 9/11, a memo was written to newly elected Prime Minister Netanyahu by neo-con Richard Perle (who along with co-author Douglas Feith would later serve in the Bush administration at the time of the Iraq War). Perle advocated a new hawkish strategy for Israel called ""A Clean Break,"" writing "" this effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq -- an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right."" In private meetings with American Jews, Netanyahu often lamented the fact that the first Gulf War had not ""taken out"" Saddam. My Dad's hero Senator Ted Kennedy and twenty-two other Democratic senators and one hundred and thirty three Democratic House members- a majority of Democrats at that time-believed correctly that Dick Cheney and his minions manipulated ""intelligence, "" and they voted against the war. History has proved them right. To this day, the American people do not know why we went to war against Iraq. All we know is that the talking points the pubic was fed by the Bush administration and their neo-con chorus were false. Similarly we have no idea what the real reason is that Netanyahu and his supporters are against the deal with Iran that every other ally of the United States supports.  In recent years, in another radical departure from the past, the Netanyahu government has taken partisan sides in American politics identifying increasingly visibly with Republicans, culminating in the unprecedented speech that Netanyahu made to a Republican controlled Congress to criticize a Democratic president's foreign policy. President Obama campaigned explicitly on changing the mind-set that led to the Iraq War and on negotiating, if possible, with Iran. He is not the one who has played ""bait and switch.""  My Dad would be relieved to know that the Schumer/Likud definition of what it means to be ""pro-Israel"" is not shared by most American Jews. Many prominent Jewish Democrats support the deal including Senators Barbara Boxer, and Bernie Sanders. A recent poll by the Jewish Journal asked whether Congress should ""vote to approve or oppose the deal."" American Jews favor approval over disapproval by a margin of 53 percent to 35 percent.  Precisely because the Iraq war was so awful and the arguments for it so preposterous, it is arguable that President Obama won the Democratic nomination in 2008 primarily because he had opposed the Iraq War. Modern day Democrats who think that actual Democratic voters have somehow warmed up to the views of neo-cons are deluding themselves. Moreover, it is not a stretch to imagine that upwards of 90 percent of non-Jews who vote Democratic support the president. Schumer et. al. must be assuming that their vote on the Iran deal will be quickly forgotten. It wont be. Recently, a minister in Netanyahu's coalition government, Religious Services Minister David Azoulay from the Orthodox Shas party claimed on Israeli radio that Reform Jews aren't ""real Jews. "" Netanyahu knew that this was not good politics at this time so he publicly disagreed with Azoulay but tellingly kept him in his government.  There is an American version of Azoulay's bigotry coming from some Jewish organizations suggesting that people like my Dad and the rest of our family are not ""real Jews"" if we don't support Netanyahu and oppose the president we twice voted for. Greg Rosenbaum, head of the National Jewish Democratic Council which supports the deal, writes ""I and members of this organization have personally found ourselves being called 'Nazis' and 'kapos,' told that we are enemies of the Jewish people and leading Israel to another Holocaust.""  Those few Democrats who play along with the Likud either for ideological reasons or to get the benefit of neo-con billionaires are in for a rude awakening. Despite a vicious well-funded PR campaign funded by Netanyahu supporters smearing and lying about President Obama during his first term, he still received 69 percent of the Jewish vote for re-election. He is the only Democrat since FDR to win a majority of the overall popular vote twice.  It's not realistic to expect politicians who you support to agree with you on all issues. But the choice between this deal and a war with Iran is one of such extraordinary consequence that it is and will remain indelible in the minds of the base of the Democratic Party. I hope that progressives mount primary challenges to every single Democrat who votes to oppose the president on this deal.  But the morality of avoiding another needless and horrible war is more important than politics. In the name of my father, I have a plea to make to those Democrats who have veered into the morass of intellectual and moral contradictions epitomized by former Senator Joe Lieberman. Search your souls and change your mind. Even if you vote against the bill, do not vote to overturn our president's veto. That, as my Dad would say, would be a shande.

What UnitedHealthcare's Second Quarter Means for Employers,"The nation's largest insurer, UnitedHealthcare, recently released financial reports for the second quarter of 2016, and from the numbers emerges a stark reminder of who is really paying for healthcare in the United States.",Business,HuffPost,"Cross-subsidization in healthcare The nation's largest insurer, UnitedHealthcare, recently released financial reports for the second quarter of 2016, and from the numbers emerges a stark reminder of who is really paying for healthcare in the United States. UnitedHealthcare, like many carriers that offered plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, found the public exchanges to be less than desirable. Nearly all exchange carriers have lost millions of dollars insuring the exchange enrollees, many of whom were formerly uninsured and sicker than expected.  Faced with such a risky pool of enrollees, UnitedHealthcare began warning in 2015 than it might pull out of the exchanges altogether. Making good on that threat in 2016, the insurer said it would cease operations in all but a few 2017 exchanges, citing marketplace unsustainability.  Indeed, according to UnitedHealthcare, the exchanges have cost the company $1.3 billion. But the losses of the exchanges don't reflect the state of UnitedHealthcare's finances--the recent financial reports showed the company's profits were actually up 11 percent in the second quarter of this year. This shows that, in spite of a rocky individual market, UnitedHealthcare is making gains--and they are large enough to offset steep losses and come out not just in the black, but 11 percent ahead.  Where are those gains coming from? Revenues are up in the company's employer, Medicaid and Medicare business lines. In other words, employers and government payers are subsidizing UnitedHealthcare's exchange segment in 2016, and this is true for other carriers as well.   Why is my group getting a big increase? So what impact will this dynamic have on employers, the more stable business line for many carriers who are facing other, more unsustainable segments? Likely an expensive one.  Anytime payers or providers face cuts to their revenues, they will try to make up those losses elsewhere. This is referred to as cross-subsidization, and it's a huge issue in healthcare. Let's look at a few examples. When an uninsured person has a medical emergency, hospitals are legally prohibited from denying them care, even if it is really unlikely that they will ever pay their bill. This is referred to as charity care, and the costs associated with uninsured patients can rack up quickly.  Many of these costs get passed onto insured patients. The same thing happens when the government refuses to increase Medicare and Medicaid payments--providers recoup some of those losses by billing private insurers higher. Then, those private insurers compensate for the higher costs that were passed onto them by in turn passing price increases onto their consumers. The same thing occurs with the cross-subsidization of less-profitable insurance segments, like the ACA marketplace. Until the exchanges become more sustainable--if they ever do--employers should expect their costs to rise to compensate for marketplace losses.  This doesn't seem fair to many employers, but unfortunately, it's just part of how healthcare works in the U.S. Because we have such a complicated system of payers--who all pay different rates for the same services--some people are bound to be paying more, making up for those who pay less. The term ""price transparency"" comes into play here. There is a growing movement for healthcare to provide more prices upfront so that consumers can make cost-effective choices. But there is pushback to price transparency from providers and payers alike, and an underlying reason is cross-subsidization. If the U.S. health system lifted the veil on how much healthcare services actually cost, and who is paying what to whom, some will discover that they are paying inflated prices. Those paying the higher prices won't like it.",08/17/16
How the New Flexible Economy Is Making Workers' Lives Hell,"We need a federal law requiring employers to pay for scheduled work. Alternatively, if American workers can't get more regular and predictable hours, they at least need stronger safety nets.",Business,HuffPost,"These days it's not unusual for someone on the way to work to receive a text message from her employer saying she's not needed right then.  Although she's already found someone to pick up her kid from school and arranged for childcare, the work is no longer available and she won't be paid for it. Just-in-time scheduling like this is the latest new thing, designed to make retail outlets, restaurants, hotels, and other customer-driven businesses more nimble and keep costs to a minimum.  Software can now predict up-to-the-minute staffing needs on the basis of information such as traffic patterns, weather, and even sales merely hours or possibly minutes before.  This way, employers don't need to pay anyone to be at work unless they're really needed. Companies can avoid paying wages to workers who'd otherwise just sit around. Employers assign workers tentative shifts, and then notify them a half-hour or ten minutes before the shift is scheduled to begin whether they're actually needed. Some even require workers to check in by phone, email, or text shortly before the shift starts.  Just-in-time scheduling is another part of America's new ""flexible"" economy - along with the move to independent contractors and the growing reliance on ""share economy"" businesses, like Uber, that purport to do nothing more than connect customers with people willing to serve them.  New software is behind all of this - digital platforms enabling businesses to match their costs exactly with their needs.  The business media considers such flexibility an unalloyed virtue. Wall Street rewards it with higher share prices. America's ""flexible labor market"" is the envy of business leaders and policy makers the world over.  There's only one problem. The new flexibility doesn't allow working people to live their lives.  Businesses used to consider employees fixed costs - like the costs of factories, offices, and equipment. Payrolls might grow or shrink over time as businesses expanded or contracted, but from year to year they were fairly constant.  That meant steady jobs. And with steady jobs came steady paychecks along with regular and predictable work schedules.  But employees are now becoming variable costs of doing business - depending on ups and downs in demand that may change hour by hour, possibly minute by minute. Yet working people have to pay the rent or make mortgage payments, and have keep up with utility, food, and fuel bills. These bills don't vary much from month to month. They're the fixed costs of living.  American workers can't simultaneously be variable costs for business yet live in their own fixed-cost worlds.  They're also husbands and wives and partners, most are parents, and they often have to take care of elderly relatives. All this requires coordinating schedules in advance - who's going to cover for whom, and when.  But such planning is impossible when you don't know when you'll be needed at work.  Whatever it's called - just-in-time scheduling, on-call staffing, on-demand work, independent contracting, or the ""share economy"" - the result is the same: No predictability, no economic security.  This makes businesses more efficient, but it's a nightmare for working families.  Last week, the National Employment Law Project reported that 42 percent of U.S. workers make less than $15 an hour.  But even $20 an hour isn't enough if the work is unpredictable and insecure.  Not only is a higher minimum wage critical. So are more regular and predictable hours.  Some states require employers to pay any staff who report to work for a scheduled shift but who are then sent home, at least 4 hours pay at the minimum wage. But these laws haven't kept up with software that enables employers to do just-in-time scheduling - and inform workers minutes before their shift that they're not needed.  In what may become a test case, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman last week warned 13 big retailers - including Target and The Gap - that their just-in-time scheduling may violate New York law, which requires payments to workers who arrive for a shift and then are sent home. We need a federal law requiring employers to pay for scheduled work.  Alternatively, if American workers can't get more regular and predictable hours, they at least need stronger safety nets.  These would include high-quality pre-school and after-school programs; unemployment insurance for people who can only get part-time work; and a minimum guaranteed basic income.  All the blather about ""family-friendly workplaces"" is meaningless if workers have no control over when they're working. ROBERT B.

No Common Ground With Trump,"It's one thing to ritually declare that if Trump truly supports policies that help working Americans, Democrats will work with him. It's another thing to believe that he will.",Politics,HuffPost,"After not quite two weeks, this is what we know about President-elect Donald Trump. He is treating the American presidency as an opportunity both for nepotism and for personal enrichment. His first appointments signal that the far right tenor of his campaign will continue into his presidency, as well as the fact that he is way out of his depth. Against this background, some Democrats are hoping that at least there are a few points of convergence. This is a huge mistake.  President Obama seems to be in what some have called ""horse-whisperer"" mode, hoping that he may yet tutor Trump on the realities of the presidency. This will be the final episode of the most disappointing aspect of Obama's administration and of this otherwise admirable man--putting hopes for common ground over ugly realities that above all require toughness.  Obama is still at it, and Trump will play along only to the extent that he finds Obama a useful prop for ""normalizing"" this transition. He will not be much of a pupil. Some Congressional Democrats, likewise, seem to think there may be areas of common ground, especially in the areas of trade policy and infrastructure. This is also mostly delusional. The New York Times' Jennifer Steinauer wrote a misleading piece last week, apparently prompted by a conversation with Chuck Schumer, now the Democrats' senate leader. To hear Steinauer tell it, Democrats are fairly lined up looking for opportunities to work with Trump and somehow split him from the Republicans.  Dream on. It's one thing to ritually declare that if Trump truly supports policies that help working Americans, Democrats will work with him. It's another thing to believe that he will. Take the case of trade. There are three areas where the Trump program bears some superficial resemblance to what progressive Democrats have long been criticizing about the bipartisan, pro-corporate trade agenda.  Camp Trump has signaled that the new administration will make three early key initiatives. First, they will suspend negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the latest case of a trade deal that serves mainly corporate interests and has minor window dressing on labor and the environment. Second, they will brand China a currency manipulator.  Third, they will advise Mexico and Canada of their intent to revise NAFTA. So what's not to like? Plenty, it turns out. For starters, there will be huge pushback from corporate elites and from the Congressional Republican leadership. A revised TPP, could be a Frankenstein, with just enough economic nationalism to annoy allies but plenty of corporate giveaways hidden in the fine print, and nothing for U.S. workers. Likewise a revised NAFTA. On China, the time is long overdue for a harder U.S. policy on China's mercantilist policies that subsidize domestic production and bribes or coerces U.S. manufacturers to relocate to China. But pressing China to actually change its policies is very tricky business. It's work for knowledgeable grown-ups, not for ignorant manipulators of symbols.  Trump has also been cavalier about threatening retaliatory tariffs, and not just against China. If Trump messes this up, we could end up with Mutually Assured Destruction of economic growth and no gain for U.S. manufacturing and workers. We do need a very different world trade regime - one that allows nations to protect labor and environmental standards, police corporate misbehavior, and have industrial policies without being branded a free-trade violator. But that progressive vision of trade is diametrically the opposite of what Trump is actually likely to carry out.   It's one thing to ritually declare that if Trump truly supports policies that help working Americans, Democrats will work with him. It's another thing to believe that he will.  We don't really know yet, because Trump's people are still learning the ropes. The risk is that Trump's first steps--announcing the renegotiation of NAFTA, suspending TPP, and branding China a currency manipulator--will produce grudging applause from Democrats, because at first blush they alter business as usual. Trump style economic nationalism is likely to be other than free trade--but a form of nationalism that serves corporations, not workers. Expect Trump to call in a few IOUs with corporate CEOs and bring back a few high-profile, photo-op manufacturing jobs--the equivalent of George W. Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" stunt on Iraq. In the short run, he could look good but the actual policies will turn out the bait and switch that is Donald Trump's trademark. Democrats would be wise to stay away until we see what the policies actually turn out to be. Then there is the case of infrastructure, long a cause of progressive Democrats. Here again, Trump's version of an infrastructure program will not be genuine public investments. It will be mostly tax credits for businesses to invest in infrastructure projects, combined with accelerated privatization that gives away public assets. Short run, this could produce some political gains for Trump. It could even produce some jobs, but nothing like those produced by true public investments. Here again, despite some superficial resemblance to the real thing, Democrats would be wise to stay away.  President Obama spent eight painful years seeking common ground with Republicans who spurned every effort in favor of working to destroy Obama. And these were actually normal if rightwing politicians, not neo-fascists. If there was no common ground to be had with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, there is surely none with Donald Trump.

Social eCommerce platforms are changing the fashion industry,,Business,HuffPost,"With the introduction of online companies like apliiq and custom ink, the fashion industry is very different today than it was ten years ago. Crowdfunding eCommerce platforms like Viralstyle have made marketing and selling clothes intrinsically different and new for consumers and distributors.  These changes have provided a wealth of benefits for buyers and sellers, and have opened up opportunities and options for both parties. The possibilities of customizability and choice have been immensely broadened for clothing buyers, while clothing sellers and distributors are able to have an easier, more direct route for finding the right customers.  For many reasons, social commerce platforms are revolutionizing the fashion industry. A few of the impacts include the production of clothes, and the availability and marketability of products. To understand the impacts, it is helpful to understand the way that the industry has functioned historically.  The way clothes are made today is vastly different from the way they used to be. Most clothes today are made from cotton, which occurs during a process in which mature cotton balls are harvested and placed in a machine that removes the cotton and seeds and transforms into usable material. While machines largely automate the process of clothing production, there are still many procedures that require handwork.  The procedure depends largely on the location and format in which the clothing is being produced. Traditional manufacturing in China has provided a large number of benefits for local clothing distributors. It offers them the ability to outsource the labor, thus producing the same clothing at cheaper costs.  Recently, local manufacturing has been revisited as a method to mass-produce clothing. Local manufacturing ensures higher product quality, and enables the clothing producer to retain clear communication between their workers and their own vision. Depending on the individual goals of the distributor, both forms of production can be considered. Most recently, social media sources like Facebook have been utilized as vehicles for selling clothing. New platforms are reshaping the way people buy and sell clothing. Using their marketing tools to tap into social media, users are able to create ads and integrate email campaigns to their lists. Earlier, consumers had to choose from a limited selection in store and online, and now these new platforms offer almost unlimited options.  By introducing personal customization, the buyer doesn't have to choose between a preset list of options; he can create the item that he is looking for using the platform's customization. In this sense, social commerce platforms empower the buyer to become their own designer. While Viralstyle doesn't make the clothing themselves, they are able to buy clothing from a supplier and print them here in the US, readily available for the customer. Crowdfunding allows us to determine the real price of the item, without any additional brand value. This new way of determining value is beneficial for both consumers and sellers. Brand value has ultimately provided to be a distraction to true value, in the past.  When consumers have evaluated clothing quality, they took into consideration the brand of the clothing. Unfortunately for the consumer, brand name has little to no relevance when it comes to the intrinsic value of the clothing. In other words, consumers were taking into consideration the brand of the item when weighing out the value of the item, despite the fact that brand name did not add any additional value. By removing the brand, consumers are able to obtain a more realistic and genuine value of the clothing item, without being distracted by the tacit marketing of the brand. This signifies a power shift from brands to consumers.   But why are new social eCommerce platforms better when compared to more traditional methods of manufacturing, selling and shipping?  ""Our clients get to tap into our trusted network of suppliers and printers, and get to take advantage of the low base cost. Our clients receive brand level margins without having to do any of the legwork,"" said the CEO and founder Tom Bell. Then, once you sell a product, Viralstyle jumps into action. We handle the production, fulfillment, and customer service of your products, while our sellers collect their profit from a successful campaign. Viral style has no print minimum, so whether it's 1 product or 1000, we still ship out the highest quality products.""  By reducing cost and risk while guaranteeing high quality, Bell hopes to assist brand creators in achieving their dreams. The luxury of having access to an existing network of printers and suppliers enables a buyer to have more options at lower cost than they traditionally would.  For those who want to create their own line of clothing but don't have access to the resources or funding to do it on their own, Viralstyle's model is based around savvy entrepreneurs who use Facebook targeting to market to specific individuals. Soon, it will be a platform for people to create their own clothing.  Today, new social commerce sites are fundamentally changing the shape of the entire industry, and will drastically alter the way in which we buy and sell clothing in the coming years.",12/17/15

Rauner Hostility to Labor Harming All Illinois,"CHICAGO-Following is the Labor Day message of Keith Kelleher, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois:",Politics,HuffPost,"CHICAGO-Following is the Labor Day message of Keith Kelleher, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois: ""This Labor Day, Illinois is facing historic hardship directly because of Bruce Rauner's hostility to the rights of workers to unite and bargain collectively for better wages, safety and workplace protections. The budget crisis we still face, which has led to credit downgrades, ballooning debt, closed social services agencies and classrooms and suffering for hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans, was manufactured for one partisan political purpose alone: To rob labor of its power.  ""At no time in recent history has any governor engaged in such a revenging and radical course and the results, which anyone can see plainly, have been devastating. Our union, which represents more than 50,000 state healthcare and child care workers, many who live at or near poverty, has gone without a contract since last year. Meanwhile, the system of care in Illinois has been thrown into utter turmoil and disarray, causing panic and confusion for countless working families, seniors and people with disabilities.  ""Our workers are not alone in their struggle: Rauner is seeking to dismantle or terminate project labor agreements, curtail workmen's compensation benefits for those killed or injured on the job and wants to weaken the right to bargain collectively. His fellow Republicans, gleeful to benefit from his checkbook politics, are enabling this radical lurch to the bottom in a way that they must know in their hearts will only make matters worse for working people and for all Illinois.  ""Labor Day is a time to remember the great sacrifices, some written in blood, that men and women made for the most basic dignity.

Jeb Bush -- the Mini-Series Continues,"I'm getting less certain by the day that Jeb Bush will end up with the GOP nomination, because once again he has shown that he doesn't have an answer for his biggest hurdle: anything that has to do with his brother.",Politics,HuffPost,"I'm getting less certain by the day that Jeb Bush will end up with the GOP nomination, because once again he has shown that he doesn't have an answer for his biggest hurdle: anything that has to do with his brother. And so, to my bewilderment, within a mere matter of weeks, here's my fourth (!) column about the former Republican governor of Florida. Moreover he's not only proving that he hasn't figured out an answer to questions about his brother, the former president (which is horrible, considering that's he's known for years as he prepared to run that these questions would obviously be coming and he's had that long to prepare), but he's now attacking Republicans, and worse he's showing that being out of political office for eight years has made him rustier than is ideal when you want to be The Most Powerful Man in the World.. On Sunday, appearing on the CBS program Face the Nation, he told host Bob Schieffer, when asked about the huge budget deficit that had skyrocketed during the George W. Bush administration: ""I mean, because of the war and because of the focus on protecting the homeland, I think he let the Republican Congress get a little out of control, in terms of the spending."" This is so wrong is so many different ways, but let's just focus on this:  Given that it's the president who prepares the budget, Jeb Bush's comments is a seriously questionable tactic to take. And given that he's slamming his own party, it's an even more questionable one. And ""a little out of control"" is a pretty eye-rolling, clueless phrase when you consider that what his brother George W. did was oversee the economic crash of the country, bringing about a recession that came close to bordering the Great Depression. Describing the economic meltdown during Bush 43 as ""a little out of control"" is like calling the Grand Canyon a little pothole. The Titanic was ""a little out of control"" compared to the collapse of the U.S. economy during the term of the elder Bush brother. And further, it's that very same Great Depression that causes the biggest problem for his answer -- That's because when Franklin Roosevelt became president after the Great Depression had hit, he turned that economic collapse around with the New Deal. And for the past 70 years, Republicans have fallen over themselves desperately trying to convince a hoped-for gullible public that it wasn't because of the New Deal social programs at all that got the United States out of the Great Depression, but rather the sheer chance that World War II occurred, whose need for increased production spurred the economy. Meanwhile, compare that to what Jeb Bush just said: that when George W. Bush dealt with war -- and did so on a far smaller scale than WWII and its two fronts in Europe and Asia -- he didn't grow the economy but crashed it. Somehow, gee, FDR was able to ""control"" the Democratic Congress, but GWB couldn't ""control"" the Republican one. So, Jeb Bush has painted himself -- and painted the GOP, most especially if he gets the party's nomination as its standard bearer -- into a corner. Either America got out of the Great Depression because of FDR's social programs, or the reason was the beneficial economics of war...in which case it shows that George W. Bush was as incompetent as the public and presidential historians believe. The reality is that FDR did benefit from increased production during WWII, and also that the country benefited from the New Deal social programs. But it's unlikely that we'll see Republicans give any credit to the latter, meaning the GWB incompetence scenario leaps to the forefront and will have to stand. But no, Jeb Bush didn't stop there. ""We were under attack and he brought, he unified the country,"" he also explained about his brother, the then-president. ""And he showed dogged determination and he kept us safe."" Let's be really clear: George Bush didn't ""unify the country."" He tore it apart in divisive battle lines so virulent that still they're still being ripped. The only way you could even consider saying he ""unified the country"" is in the public's condemnation of him, given that he left office with only a paltry 22% approval rating. And contrary to the mantra that George W. Bush Kept Us Safe, it's critical to remember -- and always remember -- that under his ""watch,"" 3,000 people actually died on American soil when George W. Bush was asleep at the wheel and ignoring Presidential Daily Briefings that said Osama Bin Laden was determined to attack the U.S. with airplanes. And if you want to take it a step further, an additional 4,500 Americans died in the Iraq War which isn't the president's fault, no, except that that war was started on a lie and should never have occurred in the first place -- something 53% of the public believes today, compared to just 42% who disagree. And still, Jeb Bush wasn't finished. As he went on and told Mr. Schieffer: ""And you know, you can talk about a lot of stuff, but when you're president of the United States and you're confronted with that kind of event, to respond the way he did is admirable."" Just to be clear, and again by way of reminder, since Jeb Bush continues trying to rewrite history, the way George W. Bush responded to America being attacked and 3,000 people getting killed was that he froze and read the book My Pet Goat to schoolchildren. But none of this is about George W. Bush. It's about how with all his time to prepare, Jeb Bush still hasn't figured out how to respond to the legacy of his brother. And for anyone who doesn't think this is a problem for him, consider that if actually wasn't a problem, Jeb Bush's answers would be oh-so-easy, praising through the roof his brother's eight years as president and exclaiming to the world what a brilliant job he did, rather than keep trying to figure out how talk himself out of a corner -- and now blame his own party. And until he can come up with a way how to address the problem of his brother and not keep shooting himself in the foot, Jeb Bush not only is going to have a much harder time becoming president himself, let alone getting the GOP nomination, but simply convincing the public that if he can't handle questions this basic, how in the world can we expect him to handle the really difficult questions of being president? Being president is hard work, his brother said. Who'd have thought that for Bush simply running for president would be almost as hard. Especially when you haven't even announced you're a candidate yet. In the end, the problem for Jeb Bush isn't what I say here about him and all his stumbles. It's what the other candidates say about him, as they spot his weakness, leap on each and every gaff once he gets up on a debate stage with them, see blood in the water, and start ganging up on the leader. Actually, in the end, the problem for Jeb Bush is that this isn't ""the end."" Because you know there will be more questions about his brother and more hiccups. As far as mini-series go, this one is open-ended. * To read more from Robert J. Elisberg about this or many other matters both large and tidbit small, see Elisberg Industries.",06/01/15
Low Hanging Fruit,,Politics,HuffPost,"Should Hillary Clinton be elected president, she stands a better chance of advancing her environmental agenda than the bitter partisan divide in Washington suggests. As a U.S. Senator from New York, she demonstrated considerable ability to reach across the aisle and work with Republican colleagues on compromise legislation.  Even if the GOP were to lose their majority in both houses of Congress (which is unlikely in 2016), they would still be numerous enough to obstruct Clinton's environmental initiatives. But after eight years of essentially stonewalling President Obama, Republican legislators will be under public pressure, along with the rest of the widely perceived do-nothing Congress, to get things done. Hence, they should be receptive to Clinton's overtures, especially if she makes it as easy as possible -- and that is what we can expect her to do. Her approach tends to be incremental rather than a heavy-handed one fell swoop. This would smooth the path for Republican lawmakers (other than Clinton's most ardent conservative critics. Some of her most progressive environmental followers wouldn't be happy either). Clinton would start with her least controversial reforms, and frame subsequent proposals in ways to placate all but her most intractable opponents on Capitol Hill. Since many Republicans reflexively see ""red"" at the mention of the word ""environment, Clinton is couching her initial proposals in terms of their economic benefits or significant public health protections. What's not to like! Her opening gambit to slow global warming is not a draconian set of greenhouse gas emission reduction regulations likely to trigger partisan paralysis. Instead, she proposes federal subsidies to fund ""green"" infrastructure such as energy efficient buildings and expansion of renewable energy. They are initiatives that arguably will invigorate the economy and improve environmental quality. Another measure would entail job retraining for coal miners out of work because of the cheaper price of natural gas. Rather than ban fracking of natural gas outright and ignite a battle royal with Republicans, Clinton would phase out the extraction procedure through gradual indirect means. The vise would be closed by regulations in response to air and water contamination as well as earthquake causation resulting from the industrial process. As Clinton's term progresses, she could push for curtailment of subsidies to fossil fuels in addition to implementation of a revenue neutral carbon tax. The latter would be offset by rebates to the general public, while having a salutary effect on air quality. It is the kind of tax that upon reflection, many Republicans could support. One more thing. Based on his campaign rhetoric, if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump should win, all Clinton environmental bets are off.",10/20/16
Courting Disaster: When Good Reactions Go Bad,"What I found striking about the reaction to the decision was not that people disagreed, but how the level of angst expressed seemed beyond irrational to the point of zealotry. And not just the general public bemoaning things, but all minority members of the Supreme Court itself.",Politics,HuffPost,"I understand that not everyone supported the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage. Not everyone supported the Court's decision on Brown v. the Board of Education either. Or Bush v. Gore. Of course, if everyone agreed about everything there wouldn't be a need for a Supreme Court. So, I understand the divide of disagreement. And I understand the hurt. And anger. More than many rulings, it dealt with an emotional topic. What I found striking, though, about the reaction to the decision was not that people disagreed, but how the level of angst expressed seemed beyond irrational to the point of zealotry. And not just the general public bemoaning things, but all minority members of the Supreme Court itself. For instance there was Chief Justice John Roberts trying to shame advocates in the case by using a ""logic"" so tangled it would confuse Lewis Carroll -- lecturing the winning side of all they'd lost ""and lost forever"" by virtue of winning. (A claim that would do honor to the Jabberwock.) On the other hand, he no doubt must actually be personally overjoyed at the decision, believing that everyone on the losing side, himself included, is now rejoicing at all they'd won -- and won forever -- by losing. By his convoluted baying at the moon, the Chief Justice apparently feels it better to deny a Constitutional right for the sake of hoping that the public of each state would all vote in favor of the law -- one day. Of course, by that same standard, we might still today have slavery, and womenfolk would still be hoping for the right to vote. Leading the way, though, in judicial distemper is Justice Antonin Scalia, whose very opening of his dissent read: ""I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion in full. I write separately to call attention to this Court's threat to American democracy."" A threat to democracy. Seriously. He wrote that. Really. And not just any democracy, but a threat most specifically to American democracy. I think it's appropriate to point out to Mr. Scalia that the Citizens United decision and the decision in favor of Hobby Lobby were FAR greater actual threats to democracy than who someone marries. When you determine that money is somehow speech, then a single person with more money that 100,000 people can push his views louder and farther in a democracy than they can together. And when people can ignore laws simply because they claim it's against their religious beliefs (most especially without having to define that religion, which can be almost anything, for who are we to say what a man's religious beliefs are), it opens the door in a democracy to anarchy. Who you marries falls quite a ways lower than those standards on the ""threat to American democracy"" scale. If it exists on the same scale at all. I expect the crazy drunk who is standing in the middle of traffic and holding up a cardboard sign to express such a screed. I don't expect it of a a Supreme Court Justice. Even one as hyperbolic as Antonin Scalia. (Indeed, I'm still waiting for the long-overdue apology from Mr. Scalia who 21 years years go claimed that Henry McCollum was the ""perfect example"" justifying the death penalty, only to have Mr. McCollum just pardoned for not committed the crime.) So, while I'm not remotely surprised that Justice Scalia had a hissy-fit meltdown over a same-sex marriage decision he didn't agree with, that it's still so angst-ridden even by his standards is impressive, if bizarre. After all, it's worth noting (and importantly so) that even before this Supreme Court decision, same-sex marriage was actually legal in 37 states throughout the U.S. and, in case it passed Justice Scalia's notice, democracy has handled itself not only just swell, but without a hiccup. I also completely understand why those with deeply-conservative religious views disagree with the decision. (Though to be clear not all those with religious views, or even all those with Christian views disagree with it. Just mostly this evangelical subset.) If in their interpretation of the Bible the decision goes against what they personally believe God teaches them. it would be surprising if they weren't upset. Just as those who are strictly religious and don't believe one should work on the Sabbath. But the lack of their understanding how laws and democracy -- and religious belief -- work is what has stood out so profoundly. Listening to the radio after the decision, I heard the head of a religious organization lamenting his unhappiness in a manner that seemed to leave him lost, and anxiously bewildered. I suspect he spoke for many when he asked, ""What about all the people whose religion teaches them that same-sex marriage is wrong???"" It was at moments such as this you wished your radio had one of those great two-way communication buttons, so you could explain. And it is an explanation that seemed pretty basic -- ""You're okay. Nothing changes. You are free to believe whatever you want to believe. That's your Constitutional and God-given right. You still have to follow the laws of the United States -- that's what democracy and citizenship is about -- but you can believe whatever you want. If you don't want to marry someone of the same sex, you don't have to. If you don't want to attend a same-sex wedding, you don't have to. If you don't even want to associate with anyone who is married to another person of the same sex, you don't have to. In fact, if you want to believe that everyone who supports the law is going to Hell, you are free to. (This doesn't mean they will, but you are free to believe it.) If you want to move to a country that doesn't permit same-sex marriage, you can -- though the number of countries open to you where you'd likely be happy to live is dwindling. All of North America, nearly all of South America, and much of Western Europe are out. You should also remember that the very day before the Court's decision, you were living in a country where 74% of the states allowed same-sex marriage, and you seemed to survive that just fine with your religious beliefs. Of course, you could also find another minister of your church whose understanding of the Bible is able to teach you a different interpretation and bring you in comfort and concert with God's word and U.S. law. After all, over the ages, mankind has adjusted so much of what the Bible says to the ever-changing world, and some things we once saw as specific teachings of God, like stoning women and stoning our children, we now see in another light. But even if you don't want to move or change your understanding, you can still believe exactly as you do now. Because religious belief is what is in your heart and your heart alone, and how how others believe and act has no bearing on that at all. It is how you manifest your personal beliefs in your actions towards others in the outside world that define who we are. Your religious belief is your own and will remain your own. It is only your actions in life towards the world that is at one with all mankind. So, don't worry. The Supreme Court ruling doesn't effect at all how you believe."" And what I understand, too, is that when there are Supreme Court decisions such as this, there will always be politicians who pander to the masses in expressing their ""outrage."" But when you go beyond that and have people like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) -- or not just ""like"" Ted Cruz, but specifically Ted Cruz -- trying to curry favor with the religious right and write an op-ed in the National Review to express their supposed displeasure with the decisions by proposing a Constitutional Amendment for public voting on Supreme Court Justices, it only serves to prove as explicitly as possible why our Founding Fathers separated the three branches of government and Justices are appointed for life. Still, as far as ""threats to democracy"" go, it would be nice to hear how Antonin Scalia chimes in on that one. * To read more from Robert J.

The Reinvention of the Cadillac: Daring to Be Different,"My dad was a loyal Cadillac driver and consumer of the iconic and classic brand. I remember climbing into the soft, plush leather seats with plenty of room to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.",Business,HuffPost,"My dad was a loyal Cadillac driver and consumer of the iconic and classic brand. I remember climbing into the soft, plush leather seats with plenty of room to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. I especially liked the seat divider that would separate my younger brother Tommy and I from each other, on long rides to visit family or friends.  As I watched the Oscars recently, I was so drawn to Cadillac's new advertising campaign that takes a bold stance for those who approach their career and lives in innovative and sometimes disruptive ways. Not a common approach for an iconic brand and a 112-year-old car company that's built its reputation on luxury and comfort - not on doing things differently. Today, that's obviously changed. Personally, I have to offer kudos to President of the Cadillac brand, Johan de Nysschen, for owning this reinvention and profiling the people who have defied the ""norm"" in their new Dare Greatly campaign. As his letter to supporters and critics alike stated, ""Only those who are willing to accept risk, who have the courage to dare greatly, shape the future. . ."" and ""drive the world forward."" Agreed! Not an entirely new concept given but one that is steeped in American history, however rarely discussed as being an exceptional or accepted position.  Once used as an adjective to describe high-end products - like Xerox was to copies, Kleenex to tissues, etc. Cadillac said luxury, high end, and evoked images of a primarily older male market (at least in my mind - I'm sure due to the fact my dad was a fan).  Not so today, if Melody Lee has anything to say about it. Lee is the Director of Brand and Reputation Strategy for Global Cadillac. Lee is a millennial who's being charged with regaining the Cadillac's brand reputation and moving it beyond that of just an automotive brand, but a brand ""period."" Clearly, Cadillac's goal is to attract a new generation of consumers who resonate with the new branding strategy of daring to follow their passion like Steve Wozniak, and be who they truly are - like fashion designer Jason Wu. Wu credits the support of a mother who dared to allow her son the comfort in himself and tools necessary to follow his dream. This messaging got my attention and has made me look at the Cadillac brand in a new and positive way.  What does your ""brand"" say about you? Is it time you step out of your old comfort zone? Clients have called me a Reinvention Catalyst because one of my specialties is helping people redefine themselves and update their brand to stay relevant in today's fast paced, ever changing media outlets. Until I saw the ad on the Oscars, it wasn't top of mind to take a Caddy for a test drive. I might now though. I dare you to as well. While you're taking off on new ventures, test drive my free Reinvention Road Map and let me be your guide.",03/17/15
These 5 Charts Prove That the Economy Does Better Under Democratic Presidents,"While conservatives often claim that their policies are good for the middle class, systematic studies by economists, political scientists and sociologists suggest these claims are overblown.",Politics,HuffPost,"As the 2016 election cycle heats up, the key question at stake for most Americans is economic growth and jobs. The debate, then, will center around what to do with the fragile recovery that overwhelmingly benefits the rich; the stagnation of middle class incomes; and unemployment -- which, particularly for young people of color, remains dispiritingly high. The right likes to argue that these conditions mark a clear failure of progressive policies, and in particular of the Obama administration. In the process, they reject policies that have, however imperfect, unequivocally strengthened the economy over the past seven years, such as the stimulus packages that came in response to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, while conservatives often claim that their policies are good for the middle class, systematic studies by economists, political scientists and sociologists suggest these claims are overblown.  Economic Growth  At the heart of the question is economic growth: Which party is better at delivering it? While economic growth alone is not sufficient for middle class and working class income growth, it is certainly necessary. The most systematic investigation of how parties affect economic growth was performed by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. Their results are unequivocal: ""The U.S. economy has performed better when the President of the United States is a Democrat rather than a Republican, almost regardless of how one measures performance. For many measures, including real GDP growth (on which we concentrate), the performance gap is both large and statistically significant."" The chart below shows the gaps in various indicators between Republican and Democratic presidents. Democratic presidents average 4.35 percent GDP growth, compared with 2.54 percent under Republicans. Democrats also presided over a lower unemployment rate, higher stock market returns, higher corporate profits, higher compensation growth and higher productivity increases. These results remain even after various controls are applied. Though the authors want to chalk these results up to luck, I have outlined a few reasons to suspect other factors may be at work.  Inequality  The middle and working class have increasingly fallen behind as the richest Americans have seized a larger share of income and wealth. So while economic growth is certainly important, how it's distributed is important as well. In a 2004 paper and a further analysis earlier this year, esteemed political scientist Larry Bartels has demonstrated that income growth is faster and more equal under Democratic presidents. He cites differences in policies like the minimum wage driving this gap. As he notes, the real value of the minimum wage increased 16 cents a year under Democrats, but decreased by 6 cents a year under Republicans. The chart below suggests this effect is driven by both market conditioning (see the gap in pre-tax income at the bottom) and redistribution (the post-tax gaps across the board).  Bartels' analysis is strengthened by a recent study from political scientists Elizabeth Rigby and Megan Hatch, who identify three major policies that states can pursue to slow growing inequality: higher taxes on the wealthy, lower taxes on the poor, and labor market policies that benefit workers (minimum wages, lack of right to work). They find that if states had adopted more liberal policies, the increase in inequality (as measured by the Gini Coefficient) would have been 60 percent smaller -- and the share going to the top 1 percent would have been cut in half. At the state level, political scientists Anne Case and Timothy Besley find that Democrats boost spending and taxes, particularly in the areas of worker's compensation and family assistance. Studies of the Medicaid expansion  have overwhelmingly shown that Republican control of government is among the most important factors in predicting whether a state will expand Medicaid. Given the positive economic and social benefits of the Medicaid expansion, this illustrates how conservative ideology can hamper good governance.  Unemployment  Possibly the most important question for Americans is jobs, and a study by political scientist Douglas Hibbs finds that ""the unemployment rate was driven downward by Democratic and Labor administrations and upward by Republican and Conservative governments."" A recent study by political scientists Bryan Dettrey and Harvey D. Palmer finds that ""economic growth under Republican presidents has a stronger effect on stimulating stock market performance, while economic growth under Democratic presidents has a stronger effect on reducing unemployment."" (see chart)  More recently, political scientists Christopher Witko and Nathan Kelly discovered that when economic growth is low, liberal and conservative governments perform similarly with regard to unemployment. However, when growth increases, Democrats do a better job turning that growth into lower unemployment. Further, in another study , they find that state-level outcomes have played an increasingly important role in shifting the income distribution, meaning that these effects are even more meaningful.   Taxes  In a new book, ""Welfare for the Wealthy,"" political scientist Christopher Faricy showsthat the rise of tax subsidies as an alternative to direct public spending -- a shift that Republicans have been eager to push for -- has had the effect of increasing inequality. (see chart) In a recent study, Faricy finds that parties don't use the tax code in the same way: Democrats favor tax credits, which help the poor, while Republicans favor tax deductions, which benefit the rich. The effect is powerful: ""A switch to a Democratic president produces an immediate increase of over $83 million in the level of tax credits."" A study by economist Howard Chernick finds  that at the state level, ""Party control by Republicans is associated with a more regressive tax structure."" Economist Olivier Bargain and others find , ""tax reforms passed by Republican governments had a positive effect on the income shares of taxpayers in the top quintile, whereas Democrats targeted the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution.""  Race  People of color make up an increasingly large share of the middle and working class. In the past, as historian Ira Katznelson notes , government policy favored white upward mobility and left people of color behind. And a recent study by political scientists Zoltan Hajnal and Jeremy Horowitz finds that there is even now a large partisan gap in who policy benefits. They find that under Democratic presidents black poverty declined by 38.6 percent, while it grew by 3 percent under Republicans. They find that ""Across 35 years of Republican presidencies, black unemployment went up a net of 13.7 percentage points. Across 22 years with Democrats, the black unemployment rate fell 7.9 points."" The authors also examined Latinos, though the data were available for fewer years. They write, ""For Latinos, Democratic presidencies are associated with large annual gains in income, substantial declines in poverty, and real drops in unemployment. By contrast, under Republican administrations Latinos tend to lose income, become poorer, and experience greater unemployment."" Further, they find deep gaps in income growth between Democrats and Republicans, with all racial groups seeing far faster gains under Democrats than Republicans, though Republicans still ensure whites gain the most (see chart).  Economic policy dramatically affects presidential races. A recent study had a bombshell finding: Federal reserve policy benefitted Republicans by reducing interest rates before elections when Republicans control the White House, but hiking them when Democrats do. The authors write, ""The behavior we have observed is consistent with the possibility that the Fed seeks to aid the election and reelection of Republican presidents."" This dynamic was noted by Bartels in ""Unequal Democracy,"" where he found that economic growth was slower during Republican presidencies, but the gap closed in the last year before elections. Ironically, then, Democrats gain very little in terms of electoral victories because of their superior economic management. In addition, as I've noted, factors like low turnout, the rise of the donor class and globalizationmake it harder for progressives to shift the income distribution. Two newstudies of finance show that Democrats have shifted to the right on financial deregulation, dramatically increasing inequality. (One of the studies linkscampaign contributions to Dodd-Frank roll call votes.) A study by political scientists Alexander Hertel-Fernandez and Theda Skocpol finds that the rise and mobilization of the small-business lobby has divided Democrats on tax issues. Further, a study by a group of political scientists notes that the strong status quo bias, exacerbated by conservative obstructionist politics, makes it increasingly difficult to implement inequality-reducing policies. The results of a broad range of studies are clear, then: Progressive policies are better for economic growth, better at creating a racially equitable society, better at strengthening the middle class and better at reducing unemployment. However, progressives must still grapple with the constraints imposed by globalized markets, the declining strength of organized labor, the rise of the donor class and low voter turnout. But the arguments that conservative policies are beneficial to the working class, or that there isn't a dime's worth of difference between the two parties, are difficult to square with the research.

"Lim Siong Guan, Group President of GIC discusses Barriers to Inclusive Capitalism",The main barrier to achieving inclusive capitalism is shorttermism - both of companies and of shareholders.,Business,HuffPost," The main barrier to achieving inclusive capitalism is shorttermism - both of companies and of shareholders.  CEOs of publicly listed companies are excessively focused on quarterly earnings rather than multi-decade profitability. This short-termist behaviour is largely because shareholders demand it. Failure to meet quarterly earnings targets typically results in investor abandonment and share price declines in the short term. Company executives, whose compensation is linked to share price performance, are compelled to boost short-term shareholder returns through job layoffs or offshoring, excessive exploitation of natural resources, paying out more dividends and buying back stock. These measures are made at the expense of cultivating a higher-skilled workforce, harvesting resources in an environmentally sustainable fashion, and investing in capital expenditures necessary for long-term growth. Short-termism not only leads to less inclusive capitalism in the short term but lowers corporate profitability in the long term. Firing workers rather than upgrading their skills destroys livelihoods, reduces consumer incomes and shrinks the pool of potential buyers for goods and services. Excessive exploitation of natural resources degrades the environment and undermines resource sustainability critical for longevity in corporate earnings. Underinvesting decreases job creation and inhibits the long term growth potential of companies. Corporate practices aligned with inclusive capitalism are therefore not only beneficial for the ordinary worker, the environment and society, but also in the best, long-term interest of companies and shareholders. Taking a long-term perspective is, however, challenging in a world that increasingly has a shorter attention span and demands ever more immediate gratification. Overcoming short-termism requires a combination of education, government policy and corporate initiative. Most critically, it requires leadership - strong leadership in both the private and public sector. Leaders in government must have the gumption and determination to overcome vested interests and implement policies that incentivise long-termist corporate and investor behaviour. Business leaders must have the strength and will to resist unreasonable demands of opportunist activist investors who are only out to make a quick buck by trading a company's stocks. Only with strong leadership can shorttermism be overcome and a more inclusive form of capitalism be achieved.",03/30/16
